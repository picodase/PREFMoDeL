However, metabolic pathways and enzymes involved are still unknown for many products of interest, which presents a key challenge in their biological production. This challenge can be partly overcome by constructing novel biosynthetic pathways through enzyme and pathway design approaches. With the increase in bio-big data, data-driven approaches using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are allowing more advanced protein and pathway design. In this paper, we review recent studies on AI-aided protein engineering and design, focusing on directed evolution that uses AI approaches to efficiently construct mutant libraries. Also, recent works of AI-aided pathway design strategies, including template-based and template-free approaches, are discussed.",2022-02-01,2021-11-09 20:28:56,2021-11-09 20:28:56,2021-11-09 20:28:56,101-107,,,73,,Current Opinion in Biotechnology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/K5JBKCQL/S0958166921001361.html

Detailed assessment of kinetic parameters established the catalytic nature of the ArCuPs. Selective alteration of outer sphere steric at the d layers above and below the Cu site allows facilitated access of substrates, where a more pronounced effect on catalysis is observed when space is created at the d layer below the Cu site via Ile to Ala mutation producing a kcat of 6.2 s-1, TONmax of 14800 and catalytic proficiency (kcat/KM/kuncat) of 340 M-1 for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Independent spectroscopic studied revealed that the rate of formation of the Cu-oxygen species and the spectroscopic feature of the most active variant is distinct compared to the other ArCuPs. Systematic alteration of outer sphere hydrophobicity led to a correlated tuning of the T2 Cu site redox potentials by ~80 mV. The enhanced activity of the ArCuP variant is attributed to a combination of steric effect that allows easy access of substrates, the nature of Cu-oxygen species, and stability of this construct compared to others, where Ile to Ala mutation unexpectedly leads to a higher thermostability which is further augmented by Cu binding.",2022-01-03,2022-01-08 03:29:54,2022-01-08 03:29:54,2022-01-08 03:29:54,,,,,,,Abiotic Reactivity of De Novo Designed Artificial Copper Peptides (ArCuPs),,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/G3VZ4QKM/Prakash et al. - 2022 - Abiotic Reactivity of De Novo Designed Artificial .pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/YG2QY63E/61cf789ca53f1b44ebaea2f4.html

Traditional classical MD models lack reactivity to explore several important phenomena; while quantum mechanical (QM) models can be used for this purpose, they come with steep computational costs. The reactive force field (ReaxFF) model bridges the gap between these approaches by incorporating dynamic bonding and polarizability. To achieve realistic simulations using ReaxFF, model parameters must be optimized against high fidelity training data, typically with QM accuracy. Existing parameter optimization methods for ReaxFF consist of black-box techniques using genetic algorithms or Monte-Carlo methods. Due to the stochastic behavior of these methods, the optimization process can require millions of error evaluations for complex parameter fitting tasks, significantly hampering the rapid development of high quality parameter sets. In this work, we present JAX ReaxFF, a novel software tool that leverages modern machine learning infrastructure to enable extremely fast optimization of ReaxFF parameters. By calculating gradients of the loss function using the JAX library, we are able to utilize highly effective local optimization methods, such as the limited Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) and Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) methods. As a result of the performance portability of JAX, JAX-ReaxFF can execute efficiently on multi-core CPUs, GPUs (or even TPUs). By leveraging the gradient information and modern hardware accelerators, we are able to decrease parameter optimization time for ReaxFF from days to mere minutes. JAX-ReaxFF framework can also serve as a sandbox environment for domain scientists to explore customizing the ReaxFF functional form for more accurate modeling.",2022-01-03,2022-01-08 03:36:09,2022-01-08 03:36:09,2022-01-08 03:36:09,,,,,,,JAX-ReaxFF,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/YW4WK6YL/Kaymak et al. - 2022 - JAX-ReaxFF A Gradient Based Framework for Extreme.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/ZGVX4D3D/61cecad57284d03c89fe39da.html

We report here on a bimetallic triply fused copper porphyrin complex (1) comprising two monomeric porphyrin units linked through β–β, meso–meso, β′–β′ triple covalent linkages, that exhibits remarkable enhancement of catalytic activity for the electrochemical HER in comparison to the analogous monomeric copper porphyrin complex (2). Spectroscopic characterization, in association with magnetic measurements, clearly establish the ground state structures of both the bimetallic and monometallic complexes as containing two and one copper (II) centers, respectively. The fused metalloporphyrin complex is found to undergo electrochemical reduction at a lower negative applied potential compared to the metalloporphyrin monomer, as evident from the significant anodic shift (~800mV) in the potential of the first reduction process. Electrochemical investigations in the presence of a proton source (trifluoroacetic acid) confirm that the catalytic activity of the fused metalloporphyrin occurs at a significantly lower onset potential, (overpotential decreased by ~320 mV), compared to the non-fused monomer. Controlled potential electrolysis combined with the kinetic analysis of catalysts 1 and 2 confirm the production of hydrogen, with 96% and 71% faradaic efficiencies and turnover numbers of 102 and 18, respectively. Kinetic investigations further reveal an observed rate constant of around 107 (s-1), implying high efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction. Mechanistic insights are presented by using a combination of UV-vis-NIR and EPR spectroscopy and electrochemistry. Our results thus firmly establish the triply fused porphyrin ligands as candidates for generating highly efficient molecular electrocatalysts in combination with transition metal centers.",2022-01-10,2022-01-10 06:35:07,2022-01-10 06:35:07,2022-01-10 06:35:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/DJ6RQCTF/Sarkar et al. - 2022 - Remarkable Enhancement of Catalytic Activity of Cu.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/IB734GZY/61d81d92f51b22552b0c3414.html

Even still, more than 20% of proteins in well-studied model animals have yet to be identified, making the discovery of their active site one of biology's greatest puzzle. Herein, we apply a Transformer architecture to a language representation of bio-catalyzed chemical reactions to learn the signal at the base of the substrate-active site atomic interactions. The language representation comprises a reaction simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) for substrate and products, complemented with amino acid (AA) sequence information for the enzyme. We demonstrate that by creating a custom tokenizer and a score based on attention values, we can capture the substrate-active site interaction signal and utilize it to determine the active site position in unknown protein sequences, unraveling complicated 3D interactions using just 1D representations. This approach exhibits remarkable results and can recover, with no supervision, 31.51% of the active site when considering co-crystallized substrate-enzyme structures as a ground-truth, vastly outperforming approaches based on sequence similarities only. Our findings are further corroborated by docking simulations on the 3D structure of few enzymes.

Natural products and their derivatives are an important source for drug discovery, and some algorithms are devoted to rapidly generating pseudo-natural products, while their accessibility and chemical interpretation were often ignored or underestimated, thus hampering experimental synthesis in practice. Herein, a bio-inspired strategy (named TeroGen) is proposed, in which the cyclization and decoration stage of terpenoid biosynthesis were mimicked by meta-dynamics simulations and deep learning models respectively, to explore their chemical space. In the protocol of TeroGen, the synthetic accessibility is validated by reaction energetics (reaction barrier and reaction heat) based on the GFN2-xTB methods. Chemical interpretation is an intrinsic feature as the reaction pathway is bioinspired and triggered by the RMSD-PP method in conjunction with an encoder-decoder architecture. This is quite distinct from conventional library/fragment-based or rule-based strategies, by using TeroGen, new reaction routes are feasibly explored to increase the structural diversity. For example, only a rather limited number of sesterterpenoids in our training set is included in this work, but our TeroGen would predict more than 30000 sesterterpenoids and map out the reaction network with super efficiency, ten times as many as the known sesterterpenoids (less than 2500). In sum, TeroGen not only greatly expands the chemical space of terpenoids but also provides various plausible biosynthetic pathways, which are crucial clues for heterologous biosynthesis, bio-mimic and chemical synthesis of complicated terpenoids.",2022-01-07,2022-01-10 06:36:55,2022-01-10 06:36:55,2022-01-10 06:36:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/229YUDUR/Zeng et al. - 2022 - Bio-inspired Chemical Space Exploration of Terpeno.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/3I4NB8AM/61d6ad296be420b5ef23272f.html

Here we report the directed evolution of a ketone synthase that oxidizes internal alkenes directly to ketones with several thousand turnovers. The evolved ketone synthase benefits from more than a dozen crucial mutations, most of them distal to the active site. Computational analysis reveals that all these mutations collaborate to facilitate the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate by generating a confined, rigid and preorganized active site through an enhanced dynamical network. The evolved ketone synthase fully exploits a catalytic cycle that has largely eluded small molecule catalysis and consequently enables various challenging functionalization reactions of internal alkenes.

In the direct simulation Monte Carlo, it has been conventional to assume that the scattering is isotropic taking the hard sphere scattering law (the variable hard sphere model). Because the simulation carries out the ensemble average, and thus the collisional deflections should be averaged at the end, it is proposed to use the preaveraged deflection angle for each collision. This is a representative single deflection angle simulation. The present work postulates a method to estimate the mean deflection angles for arbitrary force models considering the differential cross section formula and the trajectory equation. For hard spheres, the representative single deflection simulation of normal shock waves recovers the conventional computations within 3%. For Maxwell molecules, the conventional simulation in which the isotropic scattering law is taken can exactly be reproduced by the single deflection when the representative angle is adjusted to the mean deflection angle together with the reference diameter obtained in the present method.

Our simple implementation of AlphaFold2 generates peptide–protein complex models without requiring multiple sequence alignment information for the peptide partner, and can handle binding-induced conformational changes of the receptor. We explore what AlphaFold2 has memorized and learned, and describe specific examples that highlight differences compared to state-of-the-art peptide docking protocol PIPER-FlexPepDock.

For dilute samples of doubly spin-labeled molecules, the signal is a product of an intramolecular and an intermolecular contribution. We present a general model based on dipolar pathways valid for dipolar EPR experiments with spin-1/2 labels.

So far more than two hundred ncAAs have been genetically encoded by amber codon in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes using wild-type and engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)-tRNAPyl (PylT) pairs. Methanosarcina mazei PylRS (MmPylRS) is arguably one of two most used PylRS variants. However, it contains an unstable N-terminal domain that is usually cleaved from the full-length protein during expression and therefore leads to a low enzyme activity. We discovered that the cleavage takes place after A189 and this cleavage is inhibited when MmPylRS is co-expressed with Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus tRNAPyl (CmaPylT). In the presence of CmaPylT, MmPylRS is cleaved after an alternative site K110. MmPylRS is active toward CmaPylT. Its combined use with CmaPylT leads to enhanced incorporation of Nε-Boc-lysine (BocK) at amber codon. To prevent MmPylRS from cleavage after A189 in the presence of its cognate M. mazei tRNAPyl (MmPylT), we introduced mutations at P188. Our results indicated that the P188G mutation stabilizes MmPylRS.

ATE1 utilizes charged tRNAArg as the donor of the arginyl group, which depends on the activity of Arg-tRNA synthetases (RARS) and is also utilized in translation. The mechanisms that regulate the functional balance between ATE1, RARS and translation are unknown. Here we addressed the functional interplay between these mechanisms using intracellular arginylation sensor in cell lines with overexpression or deletion of ATE1 and RARS isoforms. We find that arginylation levels depend on the physiological state of the cells but are not directly affected by translation activity or availability of RARS isoforms. However, displacement of RARS from the multi-synthetase complex leads to an increase in intracellular arginylation independently of RARS enzymatic activity. This effect is accompanied by ATE1’s redistribution into the cytosol.

Furthermore, based on the electrochemical activity of p-nitrophenol (PNP), the electrochemical sensor of metalloenzyme mimics was developed. By examining the effect of the active sites of peptides and fibril formation on the degradation of OPs, the optimal metalloenzyme mimic was selected. Furthermore, optimal metalloenzyme mimics were combined with NiCo2O4 to develop an electrochemical sensor of OPs. By monitoring square wave voltammetry (SWV) signals of PNP degraded from OPs, the amounts of OPs in actual samples could be determined in 15 min.

One of the challenges in the field has been to computationally design enzymes that catalyze Kemp elimination, a reaction not observed in nature. Among several such designs, there is a series for which the catalytic rate constant could be improved by several thousand-fold by laboratory evolution, although it is still modest compared to natural enzymes catalyzing similar chemistry. These evolved designer enzymes also showed unusual temperature optima that were not related to thermal unfolding. Here, we report extensive computer simulations of both the catalyzed reaction and conformational thermodynamics of one these enzymes to analyze the underlying reasons for low catalytic activity and the anomalous temperature behavior. The results reveal that there exists a lower energy state of the enzyme–substrate complex, not seen in crystal structures with transition state analogues, which explains the low activity. Computational Arrhenius and van’t Hoff plots for the chemical step and the transition between the two reactant states are both linear, and the resulting reaction thermodynamics is found to render the catalytic barrier entirely entropic.

The active sites of different bacterial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are validated targets of antibiotics. At present, the only aaRS inhibitor approved is mupirocin (MRC) which targets bacterial isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (IleRS). The present work is aimed at understanding the lacunae of knowledge concerning the active site conformational dynamics in IleRS in the presence of inhibitor mupirocin. With this end in view, we have carried out classical molecular dynamics simulation and metadynamics simulations of the open state of IleRS from Staphylococcus aureus (SaIleRS), the closed state tripartite complex bound with cognate adenylate (Ile-AMP) and tRNA, the closed state tripartite complex bound with noncognate MRC, and the closed state tripartite complex bound with tRNA and MRC with mutated SaIleRS (V588F). The present simulation established a dynamic picture of SaIleRS complexed with cognate and the noncognate substrates which are completely consistent with crystallographic and biochemical studies and explain the existing lacunae of knowledge. The active site is significantly more compact in the Ile-AMP bound complex compared to the open state due to the closure of the KMSKS and HMGH loops and clamping down of the tRNA acceptor end near the active site gate. The present result shows that the unusual open conformational state of the KMSKS loop observed in the cognate substrate-bound complex in the crystal is due to crystallographic constraints. Although the mupirocin tightly fits the catalytic active site in the MRC-bound complex, the nonanoic acid moiety is partly exposed to the water. The KMSKS loop is pushed open in the MRC-bound complex to accommodate the noncognate MRC. New tunnels open up, extending to the editing site in the complex. Out of its three broad segments, the C12 to C17 segment, the conjugated segment, and the nonanoic moiety, the conjugated part of MRC binds most effectively with the active site of the MRC-bound complex. The aromatic residues packing around the C12 to C17 segment of MRC stabilize the tRNA hairpin conformation in a similar way as observed in the TrpRS. The V588F mutation is weakening the interaction between this region of the active site and weakens the binding of MRC in the active site. This result explains why the V588F mutation is responsible for low-level mupirocin resistance. The free energy of unbinding the conjugated segment (and C12 to C17 segment, as well) largely contributes to the total free energy of unbinding the MRC. The active site organization of IleRS from eukaryotic Candida albicans is compared with the bacterial IleRS active site to understand the low binding affinity in eukaryotic IleRS. The present study could be a starting point of future studies related to the development of effective drug binding in the SaIleRS.",2022-01-11,2022-01-18 15:34:44,2022-01-18 15:34:47,2022-01-18 15:34:44,,,,,,J.

We hypothesized that by implicitly including experimental information, a greater portion of a model could be predicted accurately, and that this might synergistically improve parts of the model that were not fully addressed by either machine learning or experiment alone. An iterative procedure was developed in which AlphaFold models are automatically rebuilt based on experimental density maps and the rebuilt models are used as templates in new AlphaFold predictions. We find that including experimental information improves prediction beyond the improvement obtained with simple rebuilding guided by the experimental data. This procedure for AlphaFold modeling with density has been incorporated into an automated procedure for crystallographic and electron cryo-microscopy map interpretation.

This is an exquisite example how self-organization of proteins and RNAs can lead to more complex functionalities in living systems. Importantly, the absence of a membrane boundary can enable easier access to larger macromolecular complexes that can be challenging to be transported across a membrane. We previously formed orthogonally translating designer membraneless organelles by combining phase separation with kinesin motor proteins to highly enrich engineered translational factors in large organelles. We also showed that even submicron thick designer organelles can be formed, by mounting them onto membranes, which, presumable assisted by 2D condensation, leads to thin film-like condensates. In this study we show that orthogonal translation can also be built with fiber-like appearing organelles. Here, the microtubule-end binding protein EB1 was used to form fiber-like OT organelles along the microtubule cytoskeleton that perform highly selective and efficient orthogonal translation. We also show an improved simplified design of OT organelles.

Most existing methods suffer from one or more drawbacks, such as: (1) lacking universality; (2) lacking robustness; (3) lacking interpretability; or (4) requiring excessive manual pre-processing.

It is not known whether long-range chiral communication exists between macromolecular tertiary structures such as peptide coiled-coils beyond the IMF distance. Harnessing the high sensitivity of single-molecule force spectroscopy, we investigate the chiral interaction between covalently linked DNA duplexes and peptide coiled-coils by evaluating the binding of a diastereomeric pair of three DNA-peptide conjugates. We find that right-handed DNA triple helices well accommodate peptide triple coiled-coils of the same handedness, but not with the left-handed coiled-coil stereoisomers. This chiral communication is effective in a range (<4.5 nm) far beyond canonical IMF distance. Small-angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulation indicate that the interdomain linkers are tightly packed via hydrophobic interactions, which likely sustains the chirality transmission between DNA and peptide domains.

Integrating protein structures improves the performance of protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction. However, the limited quantity of known protein structures restricts the application of structure-based prediction methods. Utilizing the predicted protein structure information is a promising method to improve the performance of sequence-based prediction methods. We propose a novel end-to-end framework, TAGPPI, to predict PPIs using protein sequence alone. TAGPPI extracts multi-dimensional features by employing 1D convolution operation on protein sequences and graph learning method on contact maps constructed from AlphaFold. A contact map contains abundant spatial structure information, which is difficult to obtain from 1D sequence data directly. We further demonstrate that the spatial information learned from contact maps improves the ability of TAGPPI in PPI prediction tasks. We compare the performance of TAGPPI with those of nine state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, and TAGPPI outperforms such methods in all metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to use the predicted protein topology structure graph for sequence-based PPI prediction.

We explore the influence of different types of hemes (heme b and heme c) on folding and structure prediction. Including both types of heme improves the quality of protein structure predictions. The free energy landscape shows that both types of heme can act as nucleation sites for protein folding and stabilize the protein folded state.

Here we report the directed evolution of a ketone synthase that oxidizes internal alkenes directly to ketones with several thousand turnovers. The evolved ketone synthase benefits from more than a dozen crucial mutations, most of them distal to the active site. Computational analysis reveals that all these mutations collaborate to facilitate the formation of a highly reactive carbocation intermediate by generating a confined, rigid and preorganized active site through an enhanced dynamical network. The evolved ketone synthase fully exploits a catalytic cycle that has largely eluded small molecule catalysis and consequently enables various challenging functionalization reactions of internal alkenes.

Overall, Ni and Pd catalyze a vast number of similar C–C and C–heteroatom bond-forming reactions. However, the smaller atomic radius and lower electronegativity of Ni, as well as the more negative redox potentials of low-valent Ni species, often provide higher reactivity of Ni systems in oxidative addition or insertion reactions and higher persistence of alkyl-Ni intermediates against β-hydrogen elimination, thus enabling activation of more reluctant electrophiles, including alkyl electrophiles. Another key point relates to the higher stability of the open-shell electronic configurations of Ni(I) and Ni(III) compared with Pd(I) and Pd(III). Nickel systems very often involve a number of interconvertible Ni(n+) active species of variable oxidation states (Ni(0), Ni(I), Ni(II), and Ni(III)). In contrast, catalytic reactions involving Pd(I) or Pd(III) active species are still relatively less developed and may require facilitation by special ligands or merging with photo- or electrocatalysis. However, the relatively high redox potentials of Pd(n+) species ensure their facile reduction to Pd(0) species under the assistance of numerous reagents or solvents, providing relatively high concentrations of molecular Pd1(0) complexes that can reversibly aggregate into active Pdn clusters and nanoparticles to form a cocktail of interconvertible Pdn(0) active species of various nuclearities (i.e., various values of “n”). Nickel systems involving Ni(0) complexes often require special strong reductants; they are more sensitive to deactivation by air and other oxidizers and, as consequence, often operate at higher catalyst loadings than palladium systems in the same reactions. The ease of activation and relatively high stability of low-valent active Pd species provide high robustness and versatility for palladium catalysis, whereas a variety of Ni oxidation states enables more diverse and uncommon reactivity, albeit requiring higher efforts in the activation and stabilization of nickel catalytic systems. As a point for discussion, we may note that Pd catalytic systems may easily form a “cocktail of particles” of different nuclearities but similar oxidation states (Pd1, Pdn, Pd NPs), whereas nickel may behave as a “cocktail of species” in different oxidation states but is less variable in stable nuclearities. Undoubtedly, there is stronger demand than ever not only to develop improved efficient catalysts but also to understand the mechanisms of Pd and Ni catalytic systems.",2022-01-05,2022-01-18 16:00:13,2022-01-18 16:00:13,2022-01-18 16:00:12,1180-1200,,,,,ACS Catal.,Nickel and Palladium Catalysis,,,,,,,,,,,,ACS Publications,,Publisher: American Chemical Society,,

The CRISPR system has also revolutionized the field of multiplex genome editing. Before Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE), scientists were able to edit one gene at one time. MAGE is an efficient tool for the simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes at multiple loci and changing genetic codes to create genetic variants with different phenotypes. Another emerging tool named CAGE has also empowered the ability of MAGE to perform the rewriting of the genetic codes. Recently a CRISPR-based approach, EVOLVR, has also been introduced for efficient rewriting of genetic code. EVOLVR looks promising to overcome the shortcomings of the previously used techniques for genetic code rewriting.

Their dynamic properties can depend on reversible post-translational modifications and the complex cellular milieu, which provides a crowded environment. Both influences the thermodynamic stability and folding of globular proteins as well as the conformational plasticity of IDPs. Here we investigate the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region (amino acids 613–694) of human Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1), which binds to the disease-relevant Src homolog region 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11). This binding is mediated by phosphorylation at Tyr 627 and Tyr 659 in Gab1. We characterize induced structure in Gab1613–694 and binding to SHP2 by NMR, CD and ITC under non-crowding and crowding conditions, employing chemical and biological crowding agents and compare the results of the non-phosphorylated and tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal Gab1 fragment. Our results show that under crowding conditions pre-structured motifs in two distinct regions of Gab1 are formed whereas phosphorylation has no impact on the dynamics and IDP character. These structured regions are identical to the binding regions towards SHP2. Therefore, biological crowders could induce some SHP2 binding capacity. Our results therefore indicate that high concentrations of macromolecules stabilize the preformed or excited binding state in the C-terminal Gab1 region and foster the binding to the SH2 tandem motif of SHP2, even in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation.",2022-03-15,2022-01-18 16:01:57,2022-01-18 16:01:57,2022-01-18 16:01:57,167407,,5,434,,Journal of Molecular Biology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/JNSCFKIY/S0022283621006446.html

Peptide flexibility and binding mode ranking are the two major challenges for protein–peptide complex structure prediction. Peptides are highly flexible molecules, and therefore, brute-force modeling of peptide conformations of interest in protein–peptide docking is beyond current computing power. Inspired by the fact that the protein–peptide binding process is like protein folding, we developed a novel strategy, named MDockPeP2, which tries to address these challenges using physicochemical information embedded in abundant monomeric proteins with an exhaustive search strategy, in combination with an integrated global search and a local flexible minimization method. Only the peptide sequence and the protein crystal structure are required. The method was systemically assessed using a newly constructed structural database of 89 nonredundant protein–peptide complexes with the peptide sequence length ranging from 5 to 29 in which about half of the peptides are longer than 15 residues. MDockPeP2 yielded a total success rate of 58.4% (70.8, 79.8%) for the bound docking (i.e., with the bound receptor and fully flexible peptides) and 19.0% (44.8, 70.7%) for the challenging unbound docking when top 10 (100, 1000) models were considered for each prediction. MDockPeP2 achieved significantly higher success rates on two other datasets, peptiDB and LEADS-PEP, which contain only short- and medium-size peptides (≤ 15 residues). For peptiDB, our method obtained a success rate of 62.0% for the bound docking and 35.9% for the unbound docking when the top 10 models were considered. For LEADS-PEP, MDockPeP2 achieved a success rate of 69.8% when the top 10 models were considered.

Among these, life represents perhaps the ultimate synthetic challenge. Building on an increasingly detailed understanding of the inner workings of living systems and advances in organic synthesis and supramolecular chemistry, the de novo synthesis of life (i.e., the construction of a new form of life based on completely synthetic components) is coming within reach. This Account presents our first steps in the journey toward this long-term goal. The synthesis of life requires the functional integration of different subsystems that harbor the different characteristics that are deemed essential to life. The most important of these are self-replication, metabolism, and compartmentalization. Integrating these features into a single system, maintaining this system out of equilibrium, and allowing it to undergo Darwinian evolution should ideally result in the emergence of life. Our journey toward de novo life started with the serendipitous discovery of a new mechanism of self-replication. We found that self-assembly in a mixture of interconverting oligomers is a general way of achieving self-replication, where the assembly process drives the synthesis of the very molecules that assemble. Mechanically induced breakage of the growing replicating assemblies resulted in their exponential growth, which is an important enabler for achieving Darwinian evolution. Through this mechanism, the self-replication of compounds containing peptides, nucleobases, and fully synthetic molecules was achieved. Several examples of evolutionary dynamics have been observed in these systems, including the spontaneous diversification of replicators allowing them to specialize on different food sets, history dependence of replicator composition, and the spontaneous emergence of parasitic behavior. Peptide-based replicator assemblies were found to organize their peptide units in space in a manner that, inadvertently, gives rise to microenvironments that are capable of catalysis of chemical reactions or binding-induced activation of cofactors. Among the reactions that can be catalyzed by the replicators are ones that produce the precursors from which these replicators grow, amounting to the first examples of the assimilation of a proto-metabolism. Operating these replicators in a chemically fueled out-of-equilibrium replication-destruction regime was found to promote an increase in their molecular complexity. Fueling counteracts the inherent tendency of replicators to evolve toward lower complexity (caused by the fact that smaller replicators tend to replicate faster). Among the remaining steps on the road to de novo life are now to assimilate compartmentalization and achieve open-ended evolution of the resulting system. Success in the synthesis of de novo life, once obtained, will have far-reaching implications for our understanding of what life is, for the search for extraterrestrial life, for how life may have originated on earth, and for every-day life by opening up new vistas in the form living technology and materials.",2022-01-18,2022-01-18 16:02:42,2022-01-18 16:02:42,2022-01-18 16:02:42,145-155,,2,55,,Acc.

The expectation is that any consistent differences between the derived atomic models could provide insights into variations in side-chain packing that result from differences in specimens prepared for analysis between these two methods. By computing an atomic packing score, which provides a quantitative measure of clustering of side-chain atoms in the core of the tertiary structures, it is found that, in general, for structures determined by cryo-EM, side chains are more dispersed than in structures determined by X-ray crystallography over a similar resolution range. This trend is also observed in the packing comparison at subunit interfaces. Similar trends were observed in the packing comparison at the core of tertiary structures of the same proteins determined by both X-ray and cryo-EM methods.

In our WS-BiLSTM model, the wavelet scattering convolutional network is used to extract protein features from the PSSM sliding window; the extracted features are combined with the original PSSM data as the input features of the long-short-term memory network to predict protein secondary structure.

Here, we characterize precursor-peptide BURP domains as copper-dependent autocatalytic peptide cyclases and use a combination of tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and plant genomics to systematically discover five BURP-domain-derived plant RiPP classes, with mono- and bicyclic structures formed via tryptophans and tyrosines, from botanical collections.

We describe cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of CcsBA, a bifunctional heme transporter and cytochrome c (cyt c) synthase. Models built from the cryo-EM densities show that CcsBA is trapped with heme in two conformations, herein termed the closed and open states. The closed state has heme located solely at a transmembrane (TM) site, with a large periplasmic domain oriented such that access of heme to the cytochrome acceptor is denied. The open conformation contains two heme moieties, one in the TM-heme site and another in an external site (P-heme site). The presence of heme in the periplasmic site at the base of a chamber induces a large conformational shift that exposes the heme for reaction with apocytochrome c (apocyt c). Consistent with these structures, in vivo and in vitro cyt c synthase studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of the periplasmic heme to cytochrome.",2022-01,2022-01-25 19:20:10,2022-01-25 19:20:25,2022-01-25 19:20:10,101-108,,1,18,,Nat Chem Biol,,,,,,,,en,"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,,www.nature.com,,Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Structural biology Subject_term_id: structural-biology,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/ANYQI8XR/Mendez et al. - 2022 - Cryo-EM of CcsBA reveals the basis for cytochrome .pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/RIX6YTQS/s41589-021-00935-y.html

We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of active NK1R bound to SP or the Gq-biased peptide SP6–11. Peptide interactions deep within NK1R are critical for receptor activation. Conversely, interactions between SP and NK1R extracellular loops are required for potent Gs signaling but not Gq signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that these superficial contacts restrict SP flexibility. SP6–11, which lacks these interactions, is dynamic while bound to NK1R.

During evolution, proteins acquire new functions through mutations in the amino-acid sequence. Given the advance in deep mutational scanning, recent findings have found functional change to be position dependent, notwithstanding the chemical properties of mutant and mutated amino acids. This could indicate that structural properties of a given position are potentially responsible for the functional relevance of a mutation. Here, we looked at the relation between structure and function of positions using five proteins with experimental data of functional change available. In order to measure structural change, we modeled mutated proteins via amino-acid networks and quantified the perturbation of each mutation. We found that structural change is position dependent, and strongly related to functional change. Strong changes in protein structure correlate with functional loss, and positions with functional gain due to mutations tend to be structurally robust. Finally, we constructed a computational method to predict functionally sensitive positions to mutations using structural change that performs well on all five proteins with a mean precision of 74.7% and recall of 69.3% of all functional positions.",2022-01-21,2022-01-25 19:21:26,2022-01-25 19:21:26,2022-01-25 19:21:26,e0261829,,1,17,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/SIY26IAP/Sotomayor-Vivas et al. - 2022 - Linking protein structural and functional change t.pdf

In this work, we introduce trRosettaX-Single, a novel algorithm for singlesequence protein structure prediction. It is built on sequence embedding from s-ESM-1b, a supervised transformer protein language model optimized from the pre-trained model ESM-1b. The sequence embedding is fed into a multi-scale network with knowledge distillation to predict inter-residue 2D geometry, including distance and orientations. The predicted 2D geometry is then used to reconstruct 3D structure models based on energy minimization. Benchmark tests show that trRosettaX-Single outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold on natural proteins. For instance, with single-sequence input, trRosettaX-Single generates structure models with an average TM-score ~0.5 on 77 CASP14 domains, significantly higher than AlphaFold2 (0.35) and RoseTTAFold (0.34). Further test on 101 humandesigned proteins indicates that trRosettaX-Single works very well, with accuracy (average TM-score 0.77) approaching AlphaFold2 and higher than RoseTTAFold, but using much less computing resource. On 2000 designed proteins from network hallucination, trRosettaX-Single generates structure models highly consistent to the hallucinated ones.

Molecular dynamics simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.0039 kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of 2.57 $\mathrm{kcal}/\mathrm{mol}/{\AA}$ for force, and it is more than 30 000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable for various problems in biology, chemistry and material science.",2022-01-17,2022-01-25 19:21:51,2022-01-25 19:21:56,2022-01-25 19:21:51,bbab590,,,,,Briefings in Bioinformatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/XPSCSI5U/Han et al. - 2022 - An inductive transfer learning force field (ITLFF).pdf

Retrospective studies have shown that extended sampling methods like Markov State Modeling and mixed-solvent simulations can identify cryptic pockets relevant for drug discovery. Here, we apply a combination of mixed-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) and time-structure independent component analysis (TICA) to four retrospective case studies: NPC2, the CECR2 bromodomain, TEM-1, and MCL-1. We compare previous experimental and computational findings to our results. It is shown that the successful identification of cryptic pockets depends on the system and the cosolvent probes. We used alternative TICA internal features such as the unbiased backbone coordinates or backbone dihedrals versus biased interatomic distances. We found that in the case of NPC2, TEM-1, and MCL-1, the use of unbiased features is able to identify cryptic pockets, although in the case of the CECR2 bromodomain, more specific features are required to properly capture a pocket opening. In the perspective of virtual screening applications, it is shown how docking studies with the parent ligands depend critically on the conformational state of the targets.",2022-01-18,2022-01-25 19:22:07,2022-01-25 19:22:07,,,,,,,J Chem Inf Model,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 35041430,,

Therefore, we quantitatively investigated the quality of structures at genome scales, at the level of ABC protein superfamily folds and for specific membrane proteins (e.g. dimer modeling and stability in molecular dynamics simulations). We tested template-free structure prediction with a challenging TM CASP14 target and several TM protein structures published after AlphaFold2 training.

PLP has also been reported to react with substrates and catalyze some of these reactions independent of enzymes. One such catalytic reaction is the breakdown of cysteine to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the presence of multivalent metal ions. However, the catalytic activity of PLP in catabolizing cysteine in the absence of multivalent ions is unknown. In this study, we show that, under physiological conditions and in the absence of enzymes and multivalent metal ions, PLP reacts with cysteine to form a thiazolidine product. The formation of a thiazolidine product is supported by quantum chemical simulation of the absorption spectrum. The reaction of PLP with cysteine is dependent on ionic strength and pH. The thiazolidine product slowly decomposes to produce H2S and the PLP regenerates to its active form with longer reaction times (>24 hours), suggesting that PLP can act as a catalyst. We have proposed an enzyme-independent plausible reaction mechanism for PLP-cysteine catalysis which proceeds through the formation of thiazolidine ring intermediates that later hydrolyzes slowly to regenerate the PLP. This work demonstrates that PLP catalyzes cysteine in the absence of (i) enzymes, (ii) base, and (iii) multivalent metal ions to produce H2S.",2022-01-17,2022-01-28 13:59:37,2022-01-28 13:59:37,2022-01-28 13:59:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/874ZYARM/Mulay et al. - 2022 - Enzyme-Independent Interaction of Pyridoxal-5’-Pho.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/5UVRFQX7/61e1ae164a603dc4003030fc.html

In this context, substantial attention has been paid to the role of ligand-gated conformational changes in enzyme catalysis; however, such studies have focused on tremendously proficient enzymes such as triosephosphate isomerase and orotidine 5’-monophosphate decarboxylase, where the rapid (μs timescale) motion of a single loop dominates the transition between catalytically inactive and active conformations. In contrast, the (βα)8-barrels of tryptophan and histidine biosynthesis, such as the specialist isomerase enzymes HisA and TrpF, and the bifunctional isomerase PriA, are decorated by multiple long loops that undergo conformational transitions on the ms (or slower) timescale. Studying the interdependent motions of multiple slow loops, and their role in catalysis, poses a significant computational challenge. This work combines conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics simulations with empirical valence bond simulations to provide rich detail of the conformational behavior of the catalytic loops in HisA, PriA and TrpF, and the role of their plasticity in facilitating bifunctionality in PriA and evolved HisA variants. In addition, we demonstrate that, similar to other enzymes activated by ligand-gated conformational changes, loops 3 and 4 of HisA and PriA act as gripper loops, facilitating the isomerization of the large bulky substrate ProFAR, albeit now on much slower timescales. This hints at convergent evolution on these different (βα)8-barrel scaffolds.

Rarely, carbonyl compounds are observed as a side product of the reaction. However, the selective formation of carbonyl compounds from alkenes using iron-oxo species and small molecule catalysts has not yet been achieved. Recently, a new P450-based enzyme (aMOx) has been engineered through laboratory directed evolution to directly oxidize styrenes to their corresponding aldehydes. This transformation uses an enzymatic iron-oxo species as catalytic oxidant and generates aldehydes with high activity and selectivity while suppressing epoxidation. Here, we combine extensive computational modelling together with experimental mechanistic investigations to study the reaction mechanism and unravel the molecular basis behind the selectivity achieved by the laboratory evolved aMOx enzyme. We found that alkene epoxidation and carbonyl formation pathways diverge from a common covalent radical intermediate generated after the first C–O bond formation. Although both pathways are accessible and very similar in energy, intrinsic dynamic effects determine the strong preference for epoxidation. We discovered that aMOx overrides these intrinsic dynamic preferences by controlling the accessible conformations of the covalent radical intermediate. This disfavors epoxidation and facilitates the formation of a key carbocation intermediate that generates the aldehyde product through a fast 1,2-hydride migration. Computations predicted that the hydride migration is stereoselective due to the conformational control over the intermediate species when formed in the enzyme active site. These predictions were corroborated by experiments using deuterated styrene substrates, which proved that the hydride migration is cis- and enantioselective. Our results demonstrate that directed evolution tailored a highly specific active site that imposes strong steric control over key fleeting biocatalytic intermediates, which is essential for accessing the carbonyl forming pathway and preventing competing epoxidation.",2022-01-27,2022-01-28 14:03:40,2022-01-28 14:03:40,2022-01-28 14:03:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/2BRH9Y74/Soler et al. - 2022 - Enzymatic control over reactive intermediates enab.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/2V9DYCV8/61f1677771868d5a19bf2c79.html

We report here on a bimetallic triply fused copper porphyrin complex (1) comprising two monomeric porphyrin units linked through β–β, meso–meso, β′–β′ triple covalent linkages, that exhibits remarkable enhancement of catalytic activity for the electrochemical HER in comparison to the analogous monomeric copper porphyrin complex (2). Spectroscopic characterization, in association with magnetic measurements, clearly establish the ground state structures of both the bimetallic and monometallic complexes as containing two and one copper (II) centers, respectively. The fused metalloporphyrin complex is found to undergo electrochemical reduction at a lower negative applied potential compared to the metalloporphyrin monomer, as evident from the significant anodic shift (~800mV) in the potential of the first reduction process. Electrochemical investigations in the presence of a proton source (trifluoroacetic acid) confirm that the catalytic activity of the fused metalloporphyrin occurs at a significantly lower onset potential, (overpotential decreased by ~320 mV), compared to the non-fused monomer. Controlled potential electrolysis combined with the kinetic analysis of catalysts 1 and 2 confirm the production of hydrogen, with 96% and 71% faradaic efficiencies and turnover numbers of 102 and 18, respectively. Kinetic investigations further reveal an observed rate constant of around 107 (s-1), implying high efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction.

However, modern chemical reaction ML models, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), must be trained on a large amount of labelled data in order to avoid overfitting the data and thus possessing low accuracy and transferability. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage unlabelled data to learn accurate ML models for small labelled chemical reaction data. We focus on an old and prominent problem—classifying reactions into distinct families—and build a GNN model for this task. We first pretrain the model on unlabelled reaction data using unsupervised contrastive learning and then fine-tune it on a small number of labelled reactions. The contrastive pretraining learns by making the representations of two augmented versions of a reaction similar to each other but distinct from other reactions. We propose chemically consistent reaction augmentation methods that protect the reaction center and find they are the key for the model to extract relevant information from unlabelled data to aid the reaction classification task. The transfer learned model outperforms a supervised model trained from scratch by a large margin. Further, it consistently performs better than models based on traditional rule-driven reaction fingerprints, which have long been the default choice for small datasets. In addition to reaction classification, the effectiveness of the strategy is tested on regression datasets; the learned GNN-based reaction fingerprints can also be used to navigate the chemical reaction space, which we demonstrate by querying for similar reactions. The strategy can be readily applied to other predictive reaction problems to uncover the power of unlabelled data for learning better models with a limited supply of labels.",2022-01-11,2022-01-28 14:10:15,2022-01-28 14:10:15,2022-01-28 14:10:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/F3P8HDAG/Wen et al. - 2022 - Improving machine learning performance on small ch.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/J3LFD6GV/61dd009bf51b226cc2117ca5.html

This linear VSE applies to both H-bonding and non-H-bonding interactions. It can therefore be generally applied to determine electric fields in all environments. Additionally, it allows for semi-empirical extraction of the H-bonding contribution to the blueshift of the nitrile frequency.

Bosonic and fermionic quantum potentials were utilized in bonding analysis as descriptors of the localization of electrons and electron pairs. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and the corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms linked by the bond paths. Superposition of electrostatic φ_es (r) and kinetic φ_k (r) potentials and electron density ρ(r) allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic ρ- and potential-based φ-basins; the φ_k-basins explicitly account for electron exchange effect, which is missed for φ_es-ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between ρ- and φ-zero-flux surfaces. The gap between φ_es- and ρ-basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between φ_k- and ρ-basins is proposed to be a real-space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons. The position of φ_k-boundary between φ_es- and ρ-ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of electron sharing. The stronger an H‧‧‧O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom’s φ_k-basin penetrates oxygen atom’s ρ-basin. For covalent bonds, a φ_k-boundary closely approaches a φ_es-one indicating almost complete sharing the transferred electrons, while for ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the ρ-basin of an electron occupier atom.",2022-01-17,2022-01-28 14:11:55,2022-01-28 14:11:55,2022-01-28 14:11:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/9XQVDBAG/Shteingolts et al. - 2022 - Real-Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Tr.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/UVJ4L8J8/61df2f89db4d9f6bb196c855.html

Using density functional theory and correlated wavefunction theory, we investigate the degree to which vanadium mimic electronic structure is comparable to catalytic iron intermediates. Our calculations reveal crucial structural and energetic differences between vanadyl and ferryl intermediates primarily due to differences in ground spin states of low spin and high spin, respectively. This difference in spin state leads to differences in energetics for accessing isomers that confer activity in non-heme hydroxylase and halogenase enzymes. While interconversion between monodentate and bidentate succinate isomers of the key metal-oxo/hydroxo intermediates is energetically favorable for Fe, it is strongly unfavorable in V mimics. Additionally, isomerization of a terminal metal-oxo between an axial and equatorial position is energetically unfavorable for Fe but favorable for V. Electronic structure analyses to quantify differences in binding strength of Fe and V intermediates to –ketoglutarate and succinate cosubstrates reveal that both cosubstrates bind more strongly to V than Fe.

These interactions can be exploited to design compounds for photochemical applications, including enhanced spectral conversion of light to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. While chemical discovery is time- and resource-intensive experimentally, computational chemistry can be used to screen large-scale databases for molecules of interest in a procedure known as high-throughput virtual screening. The first step usually involves a high-speed but low-accuracy method to screen large numbers of molecules (potentially millions) so only the best candidates are evaluated with expensive methods. However, use of a coarse first-pass screening method can potentially result in high false positive or false negative rates. Therefore, this study uses machine learning to calibrate a high-throughput technique (xTB-sTDA) against a higher accuracy one (TD-DFT). Testing the calibration model shows a ~5-fold decrease in error in-domain and a ~3-fold decrease out-of-domain. The resulting mean absolute error of ~0.14 eV is in line with previous work in machine learning calibrations and out-performs previous work in linear calibration of xTB-sTDA. We then apply the calibration model to screen a 250k molecule database and map inaccuracies of xTB-sTDA in chemical space. We also show generalizability of the workflow by calibrating against a higher-level technique (CC2), yielding a similarly low error. Overall, this work demonstrates machine learning can be used to develop a both cheap and accurate method for large-scale excited state screening, enabling accelerated molecular discovery across a variety of disciplines.",2022-01-11,2022-01-28 14:18:16,2022-01-28 14:18:16,2022-01-28 14:18:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/H6BZJG2R/Verma et al. - 2022 - Machine learned calibrations to high-throughput mo.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/FJDDYKWE/61d8744ba16050d63e9803c3.html

The selectivity of the small molecule remains a challenge, especially when the target protein belongs to a homologous family, which can often lead to off-target side effects. Results: We have developed a multi-task deep learning model for predicting the selectivity of small molecules on the closely related homologs of the target protein. The multi-task model, which can learn from training data of the related tasks has been tested on the Janus kinase (JAK) and dopamine receptor family of proteins. To decipher the model decision on selectivity, the important fragments associated with each homolog protein were identified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. The performance of the multi-task model was evaluated using various representation of small molecules such as fingerprints (ECFP4) and molecular graph representations. It was observed that the feature-based representation (ECFP4) with the XGBoost performed marginally better when compared to deep neural network models in most of the evaluation metrics.

Systems are simulated in various ensembles, depending on the experimental conditions one aims to mimic. While constant energy, temperature, volume, and pressure are rather straightforward to model, pH, which is an equally important parameter in experiments, is more difficult to account for in simulations. Although a constant pH algorithm based on the $\lambda$-dynamics approach by Brooks and co-workers was implemented in a fork of the GROMACS molecular dynamics program, uptake has been rather limited, presumably due to the poor scaling of that code with respect to the number of titratable sites. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an alternative scheme for interpolating the Hamiltonians of the protonation states that makes the constant pH molecular dynamics simulations almost as fast as a normal MD simulation with GROMACS. In addition, we implemented a simpler scheme, called multisite representation, for modeling side chains with multiple titratable sites, such as imidazole rings. This scheme, which is based on constraining the sum of the $\lambda$-coordinates, not only reduces the complexity associated with parameterizing the intra-molecular interactions between the sites, but is also easily extendable to other molecules with multiple titratable sites.

We conducted acid-induced unfolding of three model proteins (cytochrome c, myoglobin, and lysozyme), and the corresponding reaction aliquots upon decreasing the pH were electrosprayed for high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) measurements. The copopulated conformers were resolved, visualized, and quantified by a two-dimensional mapping of the FAIMS output. Contrary to expectations, all the above proteins appeared metamorphic (multiple-folded conformations) at the physiological pH, and cytochrome c exhibited an unusual “conformational shuttling” before forming the molten globule state. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, a wide variety of thermodynamically stable intermediate conformers, including compact, molten globule, and partially unfolded forms, was trapped from solution, probing the unfolding mechanism in detail.",2022-01-27,2022-02-05 23:01:17,2022-02-05 23:01:17,2022-02-05 23:01:17,,,,,,Biochemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACS Publications,,Publisher: American Chemical Society,,

This limitation can be addressed in E. coli using directed evolution. However, no suitable selection system is currently available to do the same in mammalian cells. Here we report virus-assisted directed evolution of tRNAs (VADER) in mammalian cells, which employs a double-sieve selection scheme to facilitate single-step enrichment of active-yet-orthogonal tRNA mutants from naïve libraries.

The Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap is one such single-molecule method with useful advantages. This approach is particularly well-suited to make detailed spectroscopic measurements of pigment-protein complexes in solution phase because it enables extended-duration single-molecule observation by counteracting Brownian motion. This Perspective summarizes recent contributions by the authors and others that have utilized the unique capabilities of the ABEL trap to advance our understanding of phycobiliproteins and the phycobilisome complex, the primary light-harvesting apparatus of cyanobacteria. Monitoring the rich spectroscopic data from these measurements, which include brightness, fluorescence lifetime, polarization, and emission spectra, among other measurable parameters, has provided direct characterization of pigments and energy transfer pathways in the phycobilisome, spanning scales from single pigments and monomeric phycobiliproteins to higher order oligomers and protein-protein interactions of the phycobilisome complex. Importantly, new photophysical states and photodynamics were observed to modulate the flow of energy through the phycobilisome and suggest a previously unknown complexity in phycobilisome light harvesting and energy transport with a possible link to photoadaptive or photoprotective functions in cyanobacteria.

A significant fraction of such efforts has been focused on distinguishing, understanding and enhancing specific energy transfer mechanisms from plasmonic nanostructures to their environment. Herein we report a synthetic strategy that brings together two of the main physical mechanisms driving plasmonic photocatalysis into an engineered system by rationally combining the photochemical features of energetic charge carriers and the electromagnetic field enhancement inherent to the plasmonic excitation. We do so by creating hybrid photocatalysts that integrate multiple plasmonic resonators in a single entity, controlling their joint contribution through spectral separation and differential surface functionalization. This strategy allows us to study the combination of different photosensitization mechanisms when activated simultaneously. Our results show that hot electron injection can be combined with an energy transfer process mediated by near-field interaction, leading to a significant increase of the final photocatalytic response of the material. In this manner, we overcome the limitations that hinder photocatalysis driven only by a single energy transfer mechanism, and move the field of plasmonic photocatalysis closer to energy-efficient applications. Furthermore, our multimodal hybrids offer a test system to probe the properties of the two targeted mechanisms in energy-related applications such as the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen and open the door to wavelength-selective photocatalysis and novel tandem reactions.",2022-01-24,2022-02-07 17:20:31,2022-02-07 17:20:31,2022-02-07 17:20:31,,,,,,,Multimodal Plasmonic Hybrids,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/7ZUWUXDS/Negrín-Montecelo et al. - 2022 - Multimodal Plasmonic Hybrids Efficient and Select.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/2FYZAJND/61eadae81fd2743c81165739.html

Since glutaraldehyde inactivates HheG, we introduced a cysteine residue in the crystal interface, which enabled thiol-specific cross-linking at predefined cross-linking sites. Variant HheG D114C displayed improved crystallizability and yielded stable and catalytically active CLECs using bis-maleimidoethane as cross-linker. Effective cross-linking at the predefined site could be confirmed via the CLEC crystal structure.

However, such predictions have been complicated by the scarcity of gas-phase experimental data, the relatively large size of the relevant molecules, and the presence of strong electron correlation effects. In this work, we apply all-electron phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) utilizing multi-determinant trial wavefunctions to six metallocene complexes to compare the computed adiabatic and vertical ionization energies to experimental results. We find that ph-AFQMC yields mean averaged errors (MAE) of 1.69±1.02 kcal/mol for the adiabatic energies and 2.85±1.13 kcal/mol for the vertical energies. We also carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a variety of functionals, which yields MAE’s of 3.62 to 6.98 and 3.31 to 9.88 kcal/mol, as well as a localized coupled cluster approach (DLPNO-CCSD(T0)), which has MAEs of 4.96 and 6.08 kcal/mol, respectively. We also test the reliability of DLPNO-CCSD(T0) and DFT on acetylacetonate (acac) complexes for adiabatic energies measured in the same manner experimentally, and find much higher MAE’s, ranging from 4.56 kcal/mol to 10.99 kcal/mol (with a different ordering) for DFT and 6.97 kcal/mol for DLPNO-CCSD(T0).

A key problem is that it has been left unclear why a living organism can have self-organizing ability leading to highly ordered structures and evolutionary behavior. This work reveals by computer simulation and experiments that a stationary state of an open reaction network really has such self-organizing ability. The point is that reaction and diffusion processes are irreversible and always forced to approach equilibrium. Therefore, a network of such irreversible processes necessarily reaches a fully-balanced stationary state and moreover a stationary state thus formed is firmly stabilized by them and kept stable against fluctuation, namely it has self-organizing ability. Dynamic self-organization revealed in this work is realized with no special mechanism such as autocatalysis and can act as the fundamental principle of evolution toward highly ordered structures and the emergence of life.",2022-02-03,2022-02-07 17:26:34,2022-02-07 17:26:34,2022-02-07 17:26:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/F9WFTQ52/Yoshiharu Mukouyama et al. - 2022 - Dynamic Self-organization in an Open Reaction Netw.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/ESFCDZFS/61fb6b160c0bf0f6b2dc8dbc.html

It also stabilizes a number of proteins required for tumor growth, which is why Hsp90 inhibitors are investigated as anti-cancer drugs. Heat shock proteins, as a class, are among the most highly expressed cellular proteins across all species.   As their name implies, heat shock proteins protect cells when stressed by elevated temperatures.  They account for 1–2% of total protein in unstressed cells.  However, when cells are heated, the fraction of heat shock proteins increases to 4–6% of cellular proteins.Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the most common of the heat-related proteins.  The ""90"" comes from the fact that it has a mass of roughly 90 kilodaltons.  A 90 kDa protein is considered fairly large for a non-fibrous protein. Hsp90 is found in bacteria and all branches of eukarya, but it is apparently absent in archaea.  Whereas cytoplasmic Hsp90 is essential for viability under all conditions in eukaryotes, the bacterial homologue HtpG is dispensable under non-heat stress conditions.This protein was first isolated by extracting proteins from cells stressed by heating, dehydrating or by other means, all of which caused the cell's proteins to begin to denature.

It has also been called the B factor or the temperature factor. Often, ""Debye–Waller factor"" is used as a generic term that comprises the Lamb–Mössbauer factor of incoherent neutron scattering and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The DWF depends on the scattering vector q. For a given q, DWF(q) gives the fraction of elastic scattering; 1 – DWF(q) correspondingly gives the fraction of inelastic scattering. (Strictly speaking, this probability interpretation is not true in general.) In diffraction studies, only the elastic scattering is useful; in crystals, it gives rise to distinct Bragg reflection peaks. Inelastic scattering events are undesirable as they cause a diffuse background — unless the energies of scattered particles are analysed, in which case they carry valuable information (for instance in inelastic neutron scattering or electron energy loss spectroscopy). The basic expression for the DWF is given by                                   DWF                  =                                 ⟨                            exp               ⁡                                (                                    i                                        q                                      ⋅                                        u                                                     )                                         ⟩                                   2                                     {\displaystyle {\text{DWF}}=\left\langle \exp \left(i\mathbf {q} \cdot \mathbf {u} \right)\right\rangle ^{2}}   where u is the displacement of a scattering center, and                         ⟨         …         ⟩                 {\displaystyle \langle \ldots \rangle }    denotes either thermal or time averaging.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client that constantly depends on Hsp90 for activity4–9. GR ligand binding was previously shown to be inhibited by Hsp70 and restored by Hsp90, aided by the co-chaperone p2310. However, a molecular understanding of the chaperone-mediated remodelling that occurs between the inactive Hsp70–Hsp90 ‘client-loading complex’ and an activated Hsp90–p23 ‘client-maturation complex’ is lacking for any client, including GR. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human GR-maturation complex (GR–Hsp90–p23), revealing that the GR ligand-binding domain is restored to a folded, ligand-bound conformation, while being simultaneously threaded through the Hsp90 lumen. In addition, p23 directly stabilizes native GR using a C-terminal helix, resulting in enhanced ligand binding. This structure of a client bound to Hsp90 in a native conformation contrasts sharply with the unfolded kinase–Hsp90 structure11. Thus, aided by direct co-chaperone–client interactions, Hsp90 can directly dictate client-specific folding outcomes. Together with the GR-loading complex structure12, we present the molecular mechanism of chaperone-mediated GR remodelling, establishing the first, to our knowledge, complete chaperone cycle for any Hsp90 client.",2022-01,2022-02-25 19:09:28,2022-02-25 19:09:42,2022-02-25 19:09:28,465-469,,7893,601,,,,,,,,,,en,"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 7893 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/S8JTNYHV/Noddings et al. - 2022 - Structure of Hsp90–p23–GR reveals the Hsp90 client.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/USFZ4338/s41586-021-04236-1.html

As substitution of sulfur for oxygen can alter metal coordination preferences, the phosphorothioate metal-rescue experiment is a powerful method for identifying metal coordination sites that influence specific properties in a large RNAs. The A9/G10.1 metal binding site of the hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz) has previously been shown to be functionally important through phosphorothioate rescue experiments. While an A9-SRp substitution is inhibitory in Mg2+, thiophilic Cd2+ rescues HHRz activity. Mn2+ is also often used in phosphorothioate metal-rescue studies but does not support activity for the A9-SRp HHRz. Here, we use EPR, electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopic methods to directly probe the structural consequences of Mn2+ and Cd2+ coordination to Rp and Sp phosphorothioate modifications at the A9/G10.1 site in the truncated hammerhead ribozyme (tHHRz).

Integral to this are Hsp90 and Hsp70, molecular chaperones that together facilitate the folding, remodelling and maturation of the many ‘client proteins’ of Hsp902. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client protein that is strictly dependent on Hsp90 and Hsp70 for activity3–7. Chaperoning GR involves a cycle of inactivation by Hsp70; formation of an inactive GR–Hsp90–Hsp70–Hop ‘loading’ complex; conversion to an active GR–Hsp90–p23 ‘maturation’ complex; and subsequent GR release8. However, to our knowledge, a molecular understanding of this intricate chaperone cycle is lacking for any client protein. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the GR-loading complex, in which Hsp70 loads GR onto Hsp90, uncovering the molecular basis of direct coordination by Hsp90 and Hsp70. The structure reveals two Hsp70 proteins, one of which delivers GR and the other scaffolds the Hop cochaperone. Hop interacts with all components of the complex, including GR, and poises Hsp90 for subsequent ATP hydrolysis. GR is partially unfolded and recognized through an extended binding pocket composed of Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hop, revealing the mechanism of GR loading and inactivation.

However, site-selectivity remains a significant challenge for enzyme-mediated deuteration, limiting access to desirable deuteration motifs.

How the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) of these two enzyme systems differentiate and determine their reactivity is not understood. In this work, we show that tyrosine placement in the SCS of non-heme iron halogenases have a huge impact on their structure, function, and reactivity. We discover that a tyrosine mutant (F121Y) in SyrB2 halogenase undergoes post-translational oxidation to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) physiologically. A combination of spectroscopic, mass-spectrometric, and biochemical studies show that the DOPA modification in SyrB2 renders the enzyme non-functional. Further bioinformatics analysis suggests that halogenases, unlike hydroxylases, have a conserved placement of phenylalanine at position 121 to preclude such unproductive oxidation. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of the SCS in controlling the structure and enzymatic activity of non-heme iron halogenases.

Known enzymatic pathways for endoperoxide installation require multiple hydrogen-atom transfers (HATs). For example, iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent verruculogen synthase (FtmOx1; EC 1.14.11.38) mediates HAT from aliphatic C21 of fumitremorgin B, capture of O2 by the C21 radical (C21•), addition of the peroxyl radical (C21-O-O•) to olefinic C27, and HAT to the resultant C26•. Recent studies proposed conflicting roles for FtmOx1 tyrosine residues, Tyr224 and Tyr68, in the HATs from C21 and to C26•. Here, analysis of variant proteins bearing a ring-halogenated tyrosine or (amino)phenylalanine in place of either residue establishes that Tyr68 is the hydrogen donor to C26•, while Tyr224 has no essential role. The radicals that accumulate rapidly in FtmOx1 variants bearing a HAT-competent tyrosine analog at position 68 exhibit hypsochromically shifted absorption and, in cases of fluorine substitution, 19F-coupled electron-paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) spectra. By contrast, functional Tyr224-substituted variants generate radicals with unaltered light-absorption and EPR signatures as they produce verruculogen. The previously reported alternative product of the Tyr68Phe variant, which is also produced in competition with verruculogen by wild-type FtmOx1 in 2H2O or with 2,3-F2Tyr, a poorer hydrogen donor than tyrosine, at position 68, is identified as the 26-hydroxy-21,27-endoperoxide product, likely formed via the C26-O-O• adduct of the longer-lived C26• with another O2 equivalent.

Similarly, CO binding to an [Fe4S4]+ cluster induces electron delocalization with a neighboring Fe site to form a mixed-valent Fe1.5+Fe2.5+ pair in which the CO-bound site adopts partial low-valent character.

Recently, it was experimentally demonstrated that the photogenerated local spins in donor–acceptor metal complexes can interact with the spin of an attached radical, resulting in a spin-coupling dependent mixing of excited doublet states, which controls the local spin density distributions on donor, acceptor, and radical subunits in optically excited states. In this work, we propose an energy-difference scheme to evaluate spin coupling in optically excited states, using unrestricted and spin-flip simplified time-dependent density functional theory (sTDDFT). We apply it to three platinum complexes which have been studied experimentally to validate our methodology. We find that all computed coupling constants are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In addition, we show that the spin coupling between donor and acceptor in the optically excited state can be fine-tuned by replacing platinum with palladium and zinc in the structure.

The inclusion of exact exchange was shown to be essential for the correct description of the long-range asymptotics of electronic interactions and thus a well-balanced description of valence, Rydberg and charge-transfer excitations. Several approaches for an efficient treatment of exact exchange have been established for the ground state, while implementations for excited-state properties are rare. Furthermore, the high computational costs required for excited-state properties in comparison to ground-state computations often hinder large-scale applications on periodic systems with hybrid functional accuracy. We therefore propose two approximate schemes for improving computational efficiency for the treatment of exact exchange. Within the auxiliary density matrix method (ADMM), exact exchange is estimated using a relatively small auxiliary basis and the introduced basis-set incompleteness error is compensated by an exchange density functional correction term. Benchmark results for a test set of 35 molecules demonstrate that the mean absolute error introduced by ADMM is smaller than 0.2 pm for excited-state bond lengths and in the range of 0.02 - 0.06 eV for vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies. Computational timings for a series of covalent-organic frameworks demonstrate that a speed-up of at least one order of magnitude can be achieved for ES geometry optimizations in comparison to conventional hybrid functionals. The second method is to use a semi-empirical tight binding approximation for both Coulomb and exchange contributions to the excited-state kernel. This simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (sTDA) achieves an accuracy comparable to approximated hybrid density functional theory when referring to highly accurate coupled-cluster reference data. We find that excited-state bond lengths deviate by 1.1 pm on average and mean absolute errors in vertical excitation, adiabatic excitation and fluorescence energies are in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 eV. In comparison to ADMM-approximated hybrid functional theory, sTDA accelerates the computation of broad-band excitation spectra by one order of magnitude, suggesting its potential use for large-scale screening purposes.",2022-02-14,2022-03-11 07:05:42,2022-03-11 07:05:42,2022-03-11 07:05:42,,,,,,,Excited-state properties for extended systems,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/T6MEBH3T/Hehn et al. - 2022 - Excited-state properties for extended systems Eff.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/E7NCWL4Y/620628077d068a64941be366.html

Specifically, (i) following Head-Gordon et al, we implement an exact evaluation of the overlap of singly-excited electronic states at different nuclear geometries using a biorthogonal basis, and (ii) we employ a unified protocol for choosing the correct phase for each adiabat at each geometry. For many-electron systems, the combination of these techniques significantly reduces the computational cost of integrating the electronic Schrodinger equation and imposes minimal overhead on top of the underlying electronic structure calculation. As a demonstration, we calculate the electronic excited-state dynamics for a hydrogen molecule scattering off a silver metal cluster, focusing on high-lying excited states where many electrons can be excited collectively and crossings are plentiful. Interestingly, we find that the high-lying, plasmon-like collective excitation spectrum changes with nuclear dynamics, highlighting the need to simulate non-adiabatic nuclear dynamics and plasmonic excitations simultaneously. In the future, the combination of methods presented here should help theorists build a mechanistic understanding of plasmon-assisted charge transfer and excitation energy relaxation processes near a nanoparticle or metal surface.",2022-02-15,2022-03-11 07:06:04,2022-03-11 07:06:04,2022-03-11 07:06:04,,,,,,,Methods to Calculate Electronic Excited-state Dynamics For Molecules on Large Metal Clusters with Many States,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/WMLEDA3Q/Chen et al. - 2022 - Methods to Calculate Electronic Excited-state Dyna.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/Q8TBFB9H/620ae7844e899e60d54e1059.html

Here, we engineer the packing of tetracene molecules within single crystals of 5,12-bis(tricyclohexylsilylethynyl)tetracene (TCHS−tetracene) to demonstrate a 5(TT) state that exhibits promising spin qubit properties, including a coherence time, T2, = 3 μs at 10 K, a population lifetime, Tpop, = 130 μs at 5 K, and stability even at room temperature.

Different topics (like limited specific activity, unfavourable kinetics or limited enzyme stability) can be addressed via enzyme engineering. On the other hand, there is also a long list of topics that are not addressable by enzyme engineering. Here typical examples are unfavourable reaction thermodynamics, selectivity in multistep reactions or low water solubility.

We present here a computational approach that focuses on stabilizing core protein structures rather than engineering the protein–protein interface. Using this approach, we designed thermostabilized interleukin-2 (IL-2) variants that bind tightly to their receptor without experimental optimization, mimicking the properties of the yeast-display engineered IL-2 variant “super-2.” Our results suggest that structure-guided stabilization may be a general method for in silico affinity maturation of protein–protein interactions.           ,                             Affinity maturation of protein–protein interactions is an important approach in the development of therapeutic proteins such as cytokines. Typical experimental strategies involve targeting the cytokine-receptor interface with combinatorial libraries and then selecting for higher-affinity variants. Mutations to the binding scaffold are usually not considered main drivers for improved affinity. Here we demonstrate that computational design can provide affinity-enhanced variants of interleukin-2 (IL-2) “out of the box” without any requirement for interface engineering. Using a strategy of global IL-2 structural stabilization targeting metastable regions of the three-dimensional structure, rather than the receptor binding interfaces, we computationally designed thermostable IL-2 variants with up to 40-fold higher affinity for IL-2Rβ without any library-based optimization.

We describe a novel strategy to develop a reliable protein–ligand scoring function by augmenting the traditional scoring function Vina score using a correction term (OnionNet-SFCT). The correction term is developed based on an AdaBoost random forest model, utilizing multiple layers of contacts formed between protein residues and ligand atoms. In addition to the Vina score, the model considerably enhances the AutoDock Vina prediction abilities for docking and screening tasks based on different benchmarks (such as cross-docking dataset, CASF-2016, DUD-E and DUD-AD). Furthermore, our model could be combined with multiple docking applications to increase pose selection accuracies and screening abilities, indicating its wide usage for structure-based drug discoveries. Furthermore, in a reverse practice, the combined scoring strategy successfully identified multiple known receptors of a plant hormone.

The observed ENDOR spectra for 3P700 and 3P680 differ in terms of the intensity loss of lines from specific methyl group protons, which is explained by hindered methyl group rotation produced by binding site effects. Contact analysis of the methyl groups in the PSI crystal structure in combination with the ENDOR analysis of 3P700 suggests that the triplet is located on the Chl aʹ (PA) in PSI. The results also provide additional evidence for the localization of 3P680 on the accessory ChlD1 in PSII.",2022-03-15,2022-03-23 05:19:22,2022-03-23 05:19:22,2022-03-23 05:19:22,,,,,,Photosynth Res,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/ZTSPKV4S/Niklas et al. - 2022 - Primary donor triplet states of Photosystem I and .pdf

To define conformational and interaction dynamics of protein complexes under different physiological conditions, various quantitative cross-linking mass spectrometry (QXL-MS) strategies based on stable isotope labeling have been developed. These QXL-MS approaches have effectively allowed comparative analysis of cross-links to determine their relative abundance changes at global scales. Although successful, it remains challenging to consistently obtain quantitative measurements on low-abundant cross-links. Therefore, targeted QXL-MS is needed to enable MS “Western” analysis of cross-links to enhance sensitivity and reliability in quantitation. To this end, we have established a robust parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted QXL-MS platform using sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linker disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), permitting label-free comparative analysis of selected cross-links across multiple samples. In addition, we have applied this methodology to study phosphorylation-dependent conformational dynamics of the human 26S proteasome. The PRM-based targeted QXL-MS analytical platform described here is applicable for all sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linkers and can be directly adopted for comparative studies of protein–protein interactions in various cellular contexts.",2022-03-15,2022-03-23 05:19:41,2022-03-23 05:20:02,2022-03-23 05:19:41,4390-4398,,10,94,,Anal.

Recently, approaches like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information is critical to these models’ accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a protein’s structure from only its primary sequence by learning a highly-accurate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that AlphaFold has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that AlphaFold’s learned potential function can be used to rank the quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without using any coevolution data. Finally, we propose a method for utilizing this potential function to predict protein structures without the need for MSAs.",2022-03-12,2022-03-23 05:20:06,2022-03-23 05:20:08,2022-03-23 05:20:06,2022.03.11.484043,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The computational approaches for CPI prediction can reduce time and costs of experimental methods and have benefited from the continuously improved graph representation learning. However, most of the network-based methods use heterogeneous graphs, which is challenging due to their complex structures and heterogeneous attributes. Therefore, in this work, we transformed the compound–protein heterogeneous graph to a homogeneous graph by integrating the ligand-based protein representations and overall similarity associations. We then proposed an Inductive Graph AggrEgator-based framework, named CPI-IGAE, for CPI prediction. CPI-IGAE learns the low-dimensional representations of compounds and proteins from the homogeneous graph in an end-to-end manner.

This task is even more challenging when both the upstream and downstream information of a time-series is important to process the sequence at a specific time-step. One typical problem which falls in this category is Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been successful in handling sequential data. These methods are demanding in terms of time and space efficiency. On the other hand, simple Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) can be trained really fast with the Backpropagation algorithm, but in practice they give poor results in this category of problems. The Hessian Free Optimization (HFO) algorithm is one of the latest developments in the field of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training algorithms which can converge faster and more accurately. In this paper, we present the implementation of simple FFNNs trained with the powerful HFO second-order learning algorithm for the PSSP problem. In our approach, a single FFNN trained with the HFO learning algorithm can achieve an approximately 79.6% per residue ( <sub>3</sub> ) accuracy on the PISCES dataset. Despite the simplicity of our method, the results are comparable to some of the state of the art methods which have been designed for this problem. A majority voting ensemble method and filtering with Support Vector Machines have also been applied, which increase our results to 80.4% per residue ( <sub>3</sub> ) accuracy. Finally, our method has been tested on the CASP13 independent dataset and achieved 78.14% per residue ( <sub>3</sub> ) accuracy. Moreover, the HFO does not require tuning of any parameters which makes training much faster than other state of the art methods, a very important feature with big datasets and facilitates fast training of FFNN ensembles.",2022,2022-03-23 05:21:34,2022-03-23 05:21:37,,27759-27770,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Access,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/J4QMMXKB/9729724.html; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/388S9ZW6/Charalampous et al. - 2022 - Solving the Protein Secondary Structure Prediction.pdf

For contact prediction, post-correction methods have been developed to remove the contribution of entropy from the predicted contact maps. However, all remaining applications that rely on the raw parameters, lack a direct method to correct for entropy. In this paper, we investigate the origins of the entropy signal and propose a new spectral regularizer to down weight it during model fitting.

Structures of ancestral and extant luciferases complexed with the substrate-like analogue azacoelenterazine or a reaction product were obtained, providing unprecedented snapshots of coelenterazine-to-coelenteramide oxidation. Bound coelenterazine adopts a Y-shaped conformation, enabling the deprotonated imidazopyrazinone component to attack O2 via a radical charge-transfer mechanism. A high emission intensity is secured by an aspartate from a conserved proton-relay system, which protonates the excited coelenteramide product. Another aspartate on the rim of the catalytic pocket fine-tunes the electronic state of coelenteramide and promotes the formation of the blue light-emitting phenolate anion.

This intermediate reacts with a nearby tyrosine residue in an intersystem-crossing reaction to give a ferromagnetically coupled (             S              = 1) Cu             II             -tyrosyl radical pair, thereby restoring the histidine and the histidine brace active site to its resting state to facilitate resumption of the catalytic cycle through reduction. This process gives the enzyme the capacity to repair any damage to the active site histidine residues ‘on the fly’, highlighting how enzymes protect themselves from deleterious side reactions during uncoupled turnover.",2022-03-15,2022-03-29 22:41:28,2022-03-29 22:41:28,2022-03-29 22:41:28,,,,,,,,,,,,In Review,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-1350705/v1,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/XLGBI23P/Zhao et al. - 2022 - The histidine-brace active site of a copper monoox.pdf

We argue that regularisers addressing oversmoothing should both penalise node latent similarity and encourage meaningful node representations. From this observation we derive “Noisy Nodes”, a simple technique in which we corrupt the input graph with noise, and add a noise correcting node-level loss. The diverse node level loss encourages latent node diversity, and the denoising objective encourages graph manifold learning. Our regulariser applies well-studied methods in simple, straightforward ways which allow even generic architectures to overcome oversmoothing and achieve state of the art results on quantum chemistry tasks, and improve results signiﬁcantly on Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets.

Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of β-d-glucose to d-glucono-δ-lactone and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of molecular oxygen. d-glucono-δ-lactone is sequentially hydrolyzed by lactonase to d-gluconic acid, and the resulting hydrogen peroxide is hydrolyzed by catalase to oxygen and water. GOx is presently known to be produced only by fungi and insects. The current main industrial producers of glucose oxidase are Aspergillus and Penicillium.

Because the enzymatic activities of many mutants are different from that of the wildtype, the genetic polymorphism of G6PD plays an important role in the synthesis of nucleic acids via ribulose-5-phosphate and formation of reduced NADP in response to oxidative stress. G6PD mutations leading to its deficiency result in the neonatal jaundice and acute hemolytic anemia in human. Herein, we demonstrate the molecular dynamics simulations of the wildtype G6PD and its three mutants to monitor the effect of mutations on dynamics and stability of the protein. These mutants are Chatham (A335T), Nashville (R393H), Alhambra (V394L), among which R393H and V394L lie closer to binding site of structural NADP+. MD analysis including RMSD, RMSF and protein secondary structure revealed that decrease in the stability of mutants is key factor for loss of their activity. The results demonstrated that mutations in the G6PD sequence resulted in altered structural stability and hence functional changes in enzymes. Also, the binding site, of structural NADP+, which is far away from the catalytic site plays an important role in protein stability and folding. Mutation at this site causes changes in structural stability and hence functional deviations in enzyme structure reflecting the importance of structural NADP+ binding site. The calculation of binding free energy by post processing end state method of Molecular Mechanics Poisson Boltzmann SurfaceArea (MM-PBSA) has inferred that ligand binding in wildtype is favorable as compared to mutants which represent destabilised protein structure due to mutation that in turn may hinder the normal physiological function. Exploring individual components of free energy revealed that the van der Waals energy component representing non-polar/hydrophobic energy contribution act as a dominant factor in case of ligand binding. Our study also provides an insight in identifying the key inhibitory site in G6PD and its mutants which can be exploited to use them as a target for developing new inhibitors in rational drug design.",2022-03-29,2022-04-04 18:04:40,2022-04-04 18:04:40,2022-04-04 18:04:40,e12984,,,10,,PeerJ,Investigating effect of mutation on structure and function of G6PD enzyme,,,,,,,en,,,,,peerj.com,,Publisher: PeerJ Inc.,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/PVUIAFKT/Rani et al. - 2022 - Investigating effect of mutation on structure and .pdf

Owing to their potency and broad-spectrum activity, they are an important part of the antibiotic arsenal. The vital role of carbapenems is exemplified by the approval acquired by Merck from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of an imipenem combination therapy to treat the increased levels of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic1. The C6 hydroxyethyl side chain distinguishes the clinically used carbapenems from the other classes of β-lactam antibiotics and is responsible for their low susceptibility to inactivation by occluding water from the β-lactamase active site2. The construction of the C6 hydroxyethyl side chain is mediated by cobalamin- or B12-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes3. These radical SAM methylases (RSMTs) assemble the alkyl backbone by sequential methylation reactions, and thereby underlie the therapeutic usefulness of clinically used carbapenems. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of TokK, a B12-dependent RSMT that catalyses three-sequential methylations during the biosynthesis of asparenomycin A. These structures, which contain the two metallocofactors of the enzyme and were determined in the presence and absence of a carbapenam substrate, provide a visualization of a B12-dependent RSMT that uses the radical mechanism that is shared by most of these enzymes. The structures provide insight into the stereochemistry of initial C6 methylation and suggest that substrate positioning governs the rate of each methylation event.",2022-02,2022-04-04 18:07:51,2022-04-04 18:07:51,2022-04-04 18:07:51,343-348,,7896,602,,,,,,,,,,en,"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 7896 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/N7R3M44R/Knox et al. - 2022 - Structure of a B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme in.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/GMDTHU32/s41586-021-04392-4.html

Addressing the question of whether active site flexibility is an intrinsic and essential property of enzymes for catalysis, we present a comprehensive study on the 3D variation of active sites of 925 enzyme families, using explicit catalytic residue annotations from the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas and structural data from the Protein Data Bank. Through weighted pairwise superposition of the functional atoms of active sites, we captured structural variability at single-residue level and examined the geometrical changes as ligands bind or as mutations occur. We demonstrate that catalytic centres of enzymes can be inherently rigid or flexible to various degrees according to the function they perform, and structural variability most often involves a subset of the catalytic residues, usually those not directly involved in the formation or cleavage of bonds. Moreover, data suggest that 2/3 of active sites are flexible, and in half of those, flexibility is only observed in the side chain. The goal of this work is to characterise our current knowledge of the extent of flexibility at the heart of catalysis and ultimately place our findings in the context of the evolution of catalysis as enzymes evolve new functions and bind different substrates.",2022-04-15,2022-04-04 18:07:53,2022-04-04 18:07:53,2022-04-04 18:07:53,167517,,7,434,,Journal of Molecular Biology,Conformational Variation in Enzyme Catalysis,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/XULN285P/Riziotis et al. - 2022 - Conformational Variation in Enzyme Catalysis A St.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/85QFB469/S0022283622000912.html

However, molecular simulations typically require specialized, manual operation ranging from model construction to data analysis to complete the entire life cycle of enzyme modeling. The dependence on manual operation makes it challenging to simulate enzymes and enzyme variants in a high-throughput fashion. In this work, we developed a Python software, EnzyHTP, to automate molecular model construction, QM, MM, and QM/MM computation, and analyses of modeling data for enzyme simulations. To test the EnzyHTP, we used fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD) as a model system and simulated the enzyme interior electrostatics for 100 FAcD mutants with a random single amino acid substitution. For each enzyme mutant, the workflow involves structural model construction, 1 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations in 100 MD-sampled snapshots. The entire simulation workflow for 100 mutants was completed in 7 h with 10 GPUs and 160 CPUs.

Herein, we demonstrate that multi-shelled metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used as a hierarchical scaffold to spatially organize enzymes on nanoscale to enhance cascade catalytic efficiency. Encapsulating multi-enzymes with multi-shelled MOFs by epitaxial shell-by-shell overgrowth leads to 5.8~13.5-fold enhancements in catalytic efficiencies compared with free enzymes in solution. Importantly, multi-shelled MOFs can act as a multi-spatial-compartmental nanoreactor that allows physically compartmentalize multiple enzymes in a single MOF nanoparticle for operating incompatible tandem biocatalytic reaction in one pot. Additionally, we use nanoscale Fourier transform infrared (nano-FTIR) spectroscopy to resolve nanoscale heterogeneity of vibrational activity associated to enzymes encapsulated in multi-shelled MOFs. Furthermore, multi-shelled MOFs enable facile control of multi-enzyme positions according to specific tandem reaction routes, in which close positioning of enzyme-1-loaded and enzyme-2-loaded shells along the inner-to-outer shells could effectively facilitate mass transportation to promote efficient tandem biocatalytic reaction.

Due to the desirable features of tiny size and minimal labeling, vibrational probes are regarded as reliable Raman reporters and employed to disentangle a multitude of biological processes.

We report a remarkable identity of the enthalpies of activation for the Stokes shifts decay rates and the millisecond C-H bond cleavage step that is restricted to side chain mutants within the identified thermal network.

OT acts through the oxytocin receptor (OTR), a magnesium-dependent G protein-coupled receptor that is a therapeutic target for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, dysfunctional labor and autism. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie OTR activation by OT and the dependence on magnesium remain unknown. Here we present the wild-type active-state structure of human OTR bound to OT and miniGq/i determined by cryo-EM. The structure reveals a unique activation mechanism adopted by OTR involving both the formation of a Mg2+ coordination complex between OT and the receptor, and disruption of transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) by OT. Our functional assays demonstrate the role of TM7 disruption and provide the mechanism of full agonism by OT and partial agonism by OT analogs. Furthermore, we find that the identity of a single cation-coordinating residue across vasopressin family receptors determines whether the receptor is cation-dependent.

We develop a new paradigm in catalysis theory in which highly fluxional systems, such as supported sub-nano clusters, isomerize on a much shorter timescale than that of the catalyzed reaction, so macroscopic properties arise from the thermal ensemble of isomers, not just the ground state. Accurate chemical predictions can only be reached through a many-structure picture of the catalyst, and we explain the breakdown of conventional methods such as linear scaling relations and size-selected prevention of sintering. We capitalize on the forward-looking discussion of the means of controlling the size of these dynamic ensembles. This control, such that the most effective or selective isomers can dominate the system, is essential for the fluxional catalyst to be practicable, and their targeted synthesis to be possible. It will also provide a fundamental lever of catalyst design. Finally, we discuss computational tools and experimental methods for probing ensembles and the role of specific isomers.

Surprisingly, structures of the variant Asn17Asp with co-purified ligand suggest that the enzyme converts to a hydrolase by serendipitous positioning of the carboxyl group. All complex structures presented here exhibit a closed Venus flytrap fold, with the enzyme exploiting the characteristic ligand binding properties of the fold for specific substrate binding and catalysis.

Here, we combine QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations with high-level electronic structure methods and the projector-embedding approach to provide reference values for the activation and reaction free energies of the catalytic CO2 fixation reaction. Our results show that carboxylation is protonation state dependent and irreversible, making the back reaction (decarboxylation reaction) highly unfavourable.

This reaction is intriguing and is of commercial importance for its potential application in the production of biofuel and plastic from biomass feedstock. Recently, the F169A mutation in the P450 GcoA elicits a promiscuous activity for syringol while maintaining the native activity for guaiacol. Using comprehensive MD simulations and hybrid QM/MM calculations we address, herein, the origin of promiscuity in P450 GcoA and its relevance to the specific activity toward lignin-derived substrates. Our study shows a crucial role of an aromatic dyad, F169, and F395 through regulating the water access to the catalytic center. The F169A mutation opens a water aqueduct and hence increases the native activity for the G-lignin. We show that syringol binds very tightly in the WT enzyme which blocks the conformational rearrangement needed for the second step of O-demethylation. The F169A creates an extra room favoring the conformational rearrangement in the demethylated syringol (3MC) and second dose of the dioxygen insertion.

This process allows endergonic reactions to be driven by exergonic ones and is an alternative, less recognised, mechanism of energy coupling to the well-known chemiosmotic principle. The electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (HydABC) requires both NADH and ferredoxin to reduce protons generating hydrogen. The mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC remains enigmatic in spite of intense research efforts over the last few years. Structural information may provide the basis for a better understanding of spectroscopic and functional information. Here, we present a 2.3 Å electron cryo-microscopy structure of HydABC. The structure shows a heterododecamer composed of two independent ‘halves’ each made of two strongly interacting HydABC heterotrimers electrically connected via a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A central electron transfer pathway connects the active sites for NADH oxidation and for proton reduction. We identified two conformations of a flexible iron-sulfur cluster domain: a “closed bridge” and an “open bridge” conformation, where a Zn2+ site may act as a “hinge” allowing domain movement.

The data provide rate constants along the reaction paths of the individual diastereomeric intermediates, revealing the origins of enantioselectivity.

In [FeFe]-hydrogenases catalysis is facilitated at a unique diiron site. The two iron ions are connected by an azadithiolate bridging ligand (−SCH2NHCH2S−, ADT) and coordinated by a CO and CN− ligand each. Upon reduction of this diiron site the ligand arrangement of a third CO ligand is heavily debated. Two main geometries that differ by the origin of a bridging ligand in between the iron ions and the occupation of a free binding site are discussed. In a first scenario a hydride is bound in the bridging position and the third CO ligand occupies the open coordination site resulting in a geometry not favourable for catalysis. Experimental data indicative of the latter case has been collected at room temperature. In a second scenario the third CO ligand occupies a position in between the two iron ions resulting in a free coordination site favoured for H2 catalysis.

The distinct EPR signatures of the TEMPO-containing polymer and its fragments in different molecular environments are used to study its degradation upon repeated cycling. A comparison between the number of EPR-active sites and the number of electrochemically active charges, as measured by cyclic voltammetry, provides information on the nature of the degradation process. Low-temperature ex-situ pulse EPR measurements on the oxidized polymer film reveal the spectrum of dilute nitroxide species, which may be associated with electrochemically inactive islands.

In order to remove expert bias from mechanistic studies and to discover new chemistries, an automated graph-theoretical methodology is proposed to provide mechanistic analysis in catalytic systems. The primary advantage of the presented three-step approach over the existing automated pathways generation methods is the integrated ability to handle multicomponent catalytic systems of arbitrary complexity (mixtures of reactants, catalyst precursors, ligands, additives, and solvent). It is not limited to pre-defined chemical rules, does not require pre-alignment of reaction mixture components consistent with a reaction coordinate and is not agnostic to the chemical nature of transformations. Conformer exploration, Reactive event identification and Reaction network analysis are the main steps taken for understanding the underlying mechanistic pathways in catalytic mixtures given the reaction mixture as the input. Such a methodology allows to comprehensively explore the catalytic systems in realistic conditions for either previously observed or completely unknown reactive events. The expert bias is sought to be removed in either of the steps and chemical intuition is limited to the choice of the thermodynamic constraint imposed by the applicable experimental conditions in terms of threshold energy values for allowed transformations.

Our entry into this field started around this time with the use of materials to produce nonclassical states of light. Here, the process of multiphoton absorption led to photon-number squeezed states of light, where the photon statistics are sub-Poissonian. In addition to the great interest in generating squeezed states of light, there was also interest in the formation of entangled states of light. While much of the effort is still in foundational physics, there are numerous new avenues as to how quantum entanglement can be applied to spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing. These opportunities could have a large impact on the chemical community for a broad spectrum of applications.In this Account, we discuss the use of entangled (or quantum) light for spectroscopy as well as applications in microscopy and interferometry. The potential benefits of the use of quantum light are discussed in detail. From the first experiments in porphyrin dendrimer systems by Dr. Dong-Ik Lee in our group to the measurements of the entangled two photon absorption cross sections of biological systems such as flavoproteins, the usefulness of entangled light for spectroscopy has been illustrated. These early measurements led the way to more advanced measurements of the unique characteristics of both entangled light and the entangled photon absorption cross-section, which provides new control knobs for manipulating excited states in molecules.The first reports of fluorescence-induced entangled processes were in organic chromophores where the entangled photon cross-section was measured. These results would later have widespread impact in applications such as entangled two-photon microscopy. From our design, construction and implementation of a quantum entangled photon excited microscope, important imaging capabilities were achieved at an unprecedented low excitation intensity of 107 photons/s, which is 6 orders of magnitude lower than the excitation level for the classical two-photon image. New reports have also illustrated an advantage of nonclassical light in Raman imaging as well.From a standpoint of more precise measurements, the use of entangled photons in quantum interferometry may offer new opportunities for chemistry research. Experiments that combine molecular spectroscopy and quantum interferometry, by utilizing the correlations of entangled photons in a Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interferometer, have been carried out. The initial experiment showed that the HOM signal is sensitive to the presence of a resonant organic sample placed in one arm of the interferometer. In addition, parameters such as the dephasing time have been obtained with the opportunity for even more advanced phenomenology in the future.",2022-04-05,2022-04-21 18:02:02,2022-04-21 18:02:02,2022-04-21 18:02:02,991-1003,,7,55,,Acc.

First, we incorporated a heterologous pAF biosynthesis pathway into a genome-scale model of E. coli metabolism, and computationally identified metabolic interventions in the host’s native metabolism to improve pAF production. Next, we explored different ways of imposing these flux interventions experimentally and found that the upregulation of flux in chorismate biosynthesis pathway through the elimination of feedback inhibition mechanisms could significantly raise pAF titers (~20 fold) while maintaining a reasonable pAF yield-growth rate trade-off.

Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type. Here, we show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies. To determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq. We found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single molecule RNA FISH, we found that pyrimidine-rich TOP motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were suﬃcient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same TOP motifs were also suﬃcient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of the TOP motif was dependent on it being at the extreme 5′ end of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the TOP-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesins. To extend these findings, we compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. We found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs in both cell types. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.",2022-04-14,2022-05-01 22:58:19,2022-05-01 22:58:19,2022-05-01 22:58:19,,,,,,,,,,,,Molecular Biology,,en,,preprint,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,DOI: 10.1101/2022.04.14.488401,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/TPEAUZ84/Goering et al. - 2022 - RNA localization mechanisms transcend cell morphol.pdf

Manufactured folic acid, which is converted into folate by the body, is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage. Folate is required for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids necessary for cell division. As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the diet, making it an essential nutrient. It occurs naturally in many foods. The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements.Folate in the form of folic acid is used to treat anemia caused by folate deficiency. Folic acid is also used as a supplement by women during pregnancy to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the baby. Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs. More than 80 countries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs. Long-term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid is associated with a small reduction in the risk of stroke and an increased risk of prostate cancer. There are concerns that large amounts of supplemental folic acid can hide vitamin B12 deficiency.Not consuming enough folate can lead to folate deficiency. This may result in a type of anemia in which red blood cells become abnormally large. Symptoms may include feeling tired, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, open sores on the tongue, and changes in the color of the skin or hair. Folate deficiency in children may develop within a month of poor dietary intake. In adults, normal total body folate is between 10 and 30 mg with blood levels of greater than 7 nmol/L (3 ng/mL).Folate was discovered between 1931 and 1943. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2019, it was the 89th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions.

In this working paper we demonstrate an efficient protocol that uses the structural diversity from AF2 as a starting point to perform Artificial Intelligence augmented enhanced molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically we use the ``Reweighted Autoencoded Variational Bayes for Enhanced Sampling (RAVE)"" method as post-processing on AF2, and thus the protocol shown here is called AlphaFold2-RAVE. These simulations expand upon the results from AF2 ranking them as per their correct Boltzmann weights. This schema for going from sequence to Boltzmann weighted ensemble of structures is demonstrated here for a small cold-shock protein, and will be expanded to include many more sequences together with an easy-to-use open-source code.",2022-05-26,2022-05-26 21:44:40,2022-05-26 21:44:40,2022-05-26 21:44:40,2022.05.25.493365,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4%, compared to 32.9% for Rosetta. Incorporation of noise during training improves sequence recovery on protein structure models, and produces sequences which more robustly encode their structures as assessed using structure prediction algorithms.

This paper finds that at least part of this gap is due to the latter: women in research teams are significantly less likely to be credited with authorship than are men. The findings are consistent across three very different sources of data. Analysis of the first source - large scale administrative data on research teams, team scientific output, and attribution of credit - show that women are significantly less likely to be named on any given article or patent produced by their team relative to their peers. The gender gap in attribution is found across almost all scientific fields and career stages. The second source – an extensive survey of authors – similarly shows that women’s scientific contributions are systematically less likely to be recognized. The third source – qualitative responses – suggests that the reason is that their work is often not known, not appreciated, or ignored.

Most water molecules act as solvent media; hence, their roles may be considered implicitly in theoretical treatments of protein structure and function. However, some water molecules interact intimately with proteins and require explicit treatment to understand their effects. Most physics-based computational methods are limited in their ability to accurately locate water molecules on protein surfaces because of inaccurate energy functions. Instead of relying on an energy function, this study attempts to learn the locations of water molecules from structural data. GalaxyWater-convolutional neural network (CNN) predicts water positions on protein chains, protein–protein interfaces, and protein–compound binding sites using a 3D-CNN model that is trained to generate a water score map on a given protein structure. The training data are compiled from high-resolution protein crystal structures resolved together with water molecules. GalaxyWater-CNN shows improved water prediction performance both in the coverage of crystal water molecules and in the accuracy of the predicted water positions when compared with previous energy-based methods. This method shows a superior performance in predicting water molecules that form hydrogen-bond networks precisely.

Consistent with this conclusion, purified PilC1 and PilC2 were capable of saturable binding to epithelial cells. Additional analysis revealed that PilC1 but not PilC2 also mediated adherence to selected extracellular matrix proteins, underscoring the differential binding specificity of these adhesins. Examination of deletion constructs and purified PilC1 and PilC2 fragments localized adhesive activity to the N-terminal region of both PilC1 and PilC2. The deletion constructs also localized the twitching motility property to the N-terminal region of these proteins. In contrast, the deletion constructs established that the pilus biogenesis function of PilC1 and PilC2 resides in the C-terminal region of these proteins.

They also accumulate in specialized plastids named chromoplasts, providing color to non-photosynthetic tissues such as flower petals and ripe fruit. Carotenoid accumulation in chromoplast requires specialized structures and proteins such as fibrillins. Although fibrillins were first reported as structural components of carotenoid sequestering structures in chromoplasts, later work revealed roles in chloroplasts and other plastid types. However, the association of fibrillins with carotenoids in plastids other than chromoplasts has remained unexplored. Here we show that a member of the fibrillin family, FBN6, interacts with phytoene synthase (PSY, the first committed and rate-determining step of the carotenoid pathway) to promote its enzymatic activity. Transient overexpression of FBN6 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves results in a higher production of phytoene, the product of PSY activity, whereas loss of FBN6 activity in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants dramatically reduces the production of carotenoids during seedling deetiolation and after exposure to high light. Our work hence demonstrates that fibrillins not only promote the accumulation of carotenoids but also their biosynthesis.",2022-07-02,2022-07-04 17:15:05,2022-07-04 17:15:05,2022-07-04 17:15:05,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We noticed a potentially interesting switch in the use of glutamine synthetase (GS) isoforms –from the chloroplast isoform to the mitochondrial one- for nitrogen assimilation. To further explore this prediction, we characterized transgenic tomato plants over-expressing two tomato GS genes, GS1 and GS2, targeted to mitochondria. Both sets of transgenic plants were characterized as displaying faster growth rate, early flowering and increased fruit yield. In leaves, metabolomic profiling and enzyme activity analysis pointed that GS activity in mitochondrial plays a role in increasing the intracellular synthesis and subsequent export of sugar. Consistent with these changes, higher sucrose concentration in leaf exudates and reduced activities of enzymes involved in leaf starch synthesis were observed. Moreover, mitochondrial GS activity affected chloroplast redox status in a manner that modulated photorespiration and nitrogen metabolism.

Despite the alleged importance of cell wall traits in drought responses, their significance in the succulent syndrome has long been overlooked. Here, by analysing published pressure–volume curves, we show that elastic adjustment, whereby plants change cell wall elasticity, is uniquely beneficial to succulents for avoiding turgor loss. In addition, we used comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP) to assess the biochemical composition of cell walls in leaves. Across phylogenetically diverse species, we uncover several differences in cell wall biochemistry between succulent and non-succulent leaves, pointing to the existence of a ‘succulent glycome’. We also highlight the glycomic diversity among succulent plants, with some glycomic features being restricted to certain succulent lineages. In conclusion, we suggest that cell wall biomechanics and biochemistry should be considered among the characteristic traits that make up the succulent syndrome.",2022-06-27,2022-07-04 17:16:12,2022-07-04 17:16:12,2022-07-04 17:16:12,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In addition to abiotic factors like nutrients or mechanical resistance, plant roots also respond to temperature variation. Below the heat stress threshold, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings react to elevated temperature by promoting primary root growth, possibly to reach deeper soil regions with potentially better water saturation. While above-ground thermomorphogenesis is enabled by thermo-sensitive cell elongation, it was unknown how temperature modulates root growth. We here show that roots are able to sense and respond to elevated temperature independent of shoot-derived signals. A yet unknown root thermosensor seems to employ auxin as a messenger to promote primary root growth. Growth is primarily achieved by accelerating cell division rates in the root apical meristem, likely maintained via temperature-sensitive organization of the polar auxin transport system. Hence, the primary cellular target of elevated ambient temperature differs fundamentally between root and shoot tissues, while the messenger auxin that relays temperature information to elongating or dividing cells, respectively, remains the same.",2022-06-25,2022-07-04 17:16:37,2022-07-04 17:16:37,2022-07-04 17:16:37,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

However, in vivo DNA is not isolated, but is packed in chromatin fibers, the fundamental unit of which is the nucleosome. Biochemical experiments have shown that ncRNA binding to nucleosomal DNA is elevated at DNA entry and exit sites and is dependent on the presence of the H3 N-terminal tails.

Here, we have examined the mechanisms and effects of RDD formation in the context of the nucleosome using a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

The solution pH is one of the critical factors that can influence ligand binding to a protein cavity, especially in enzymes whose function is sensitive to the pH. Using computer simulations, we studied the pH effect on the binding of a guanidinium ion (Gdm+) to the active site of hen-egg white lysozyme (HEWL). HEWL serves as a model system for enzymes with two acidic residues in the active site and ligands with Gdm+ moieties, which can bind to the active sites of such enzymes and are present in several approved drugs treating various disorders. The computed free energy surface (FES) shows that Gdm+ binds to the HEWL active site using two dominant binding pathways populating multiple intermediates. We show that the residues close to the active site that can anchor the ligand could play a critical role in ligand binding. Using a Markov state model, we quantified the lifetimes and kinetic pathways connecting the different states in the FES. The protonation and deprotonation of the acidic residues in the active site in response to the pH change strongly influence the Gdm+ binding. There is a sharp jump in the ligand-binding rate constant when the pH approaches the largest pKa of the acidic residue present in the active site. The simulations reveal that, at most, three Gdm+ can bind at the active site, with the Gdm+ bound in the cavity of the active site acting as a scaffold for the other two Gdm+ ions binding. This result implies the possibility of designing single large molecules containing multiple Gdm+ moieties that can have high binding affinities to inhibit the function of enzymes with two acidic residues in their active site.",2022-07-03,2022-07-04 17:20:06,2022-07-04 17:20:06,2022-07-04 17:20:06,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We examine the hub protein LC8, which binds to disordered regions of 100+ client proteins in a wide range of stoichiometries. Despite evidence that LC8 binds clients cooperatively, prior ITC thermodynamic analyses have relied on models that do not accommodate allostery, and furthermore do not account for critical uncertainties in analyte concentrations. To characterize allostery in a more rigorous fashion, we build on existing Bayesian approaches to ITC to quantify thermodynamic parameters for multi-step binding interactions impacted by significant uncertainty in protein concentration. Notably, we account for a previously unrecognized intrinsic ambiguity in concentrations in standard binding models and clarify how this ambiguity impacts the extent to which binding parameters can be determined in cases of highly uncertain analyte concentrations. Our approach is applicable to a host of multi-step binding interactions, and we use it to investigate two systems. First, we deeply examine 2:2 LC8 binding and find it to be significantly positively cooperative with high confidence for multiple clients. Building on observations in the LC8 system, we develop a system-agnostic ‘phase diagram’ calculated from synthetic data demonstrating that certain binding parameters intrinsically inflate parameter uncertainty in ITC analysis, independent of experimental uncertainties.

Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature. Within such a fluid, there exists no preferential direction of flow (as in transport phenomena). More specifically, the fluid's overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time. The kinetic energies of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations, sum up to the caloric component of a fluid's internal energy (the equipartition theorem). This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant Clarkia pulchella immersed in water. In 1905, almost eighty years later, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen particles as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific contributions. The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 ""for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter"".The many-body interactions that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. In consequence, only probabilistic models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it. Two such models of the statistical mechanics, due to Einstein and Smoluchowski, are presented below. Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the stochastic process models. There exist sequences of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which converge (in the limit) to Brownian motion (see random walk and Donsker's theorem).",2022-06-10,2022-07-04 19:16:36,2022-07-04 19:16:36,2022-07-04 19:16:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,Page Version ID: 1092454887,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/RPBBVX6A/Brownian_motion.html

Current studies use existing techniques, such as weight constraint, representation constraint, which are derived from images or text data, to transfer the invariant knowledge from the pre-train stage to fine-tuning stage. However, these methods failed to preserve invariances from graph structure and Graph Neural Network (GNN) style models. In this paper, we present a novel optimal transport-based fine-tuning framework called GTOT-Tuning, namely, Graph Topology induced Optimal Transport fine-Tuning, for GNN style backbones. GTOT-Tuning is required to utilize the property of graph data to enhance the preservation of representation produced by fine-tuned networks. Toward this goal, we formulate graph local knowledge transfer as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with a structural prior and construct the GTOT regularizer to constrain the fine-tuned model behaviors. By using the adjacency relationship amongst nodes, the GTOT regularizer achieves node-level optimal transport procedures and reduces redundant transport procedures, resulting in efficient knowledge transfer from the pre-trained models. We evaluate GTOT-Tuning on eight downstream tasks with various GNN backbones and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance for GNNs.",2022-03-20,2022-07-06 18:52:34,2022-07-06 18:52:34,2022-07-06 18:52:34,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv:2203.10453 [cs],,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/BAC5CUQL/Zhang et al. - 2022 - Fine-Tuning Graph Neural Networks via Graph Topolo.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/ZU2IK46Z/2203.html

Most GNNs use a message passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising results, MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing and under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the literature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most state-of-the-art graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of the graph, are not differentiable (inductive) and require the tuning of hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose DiffWire, a novel framework for graph rewiring in MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and parameter-free by leveraging the Lov\'asz bound. Our approach provides a unified theory for graph rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers in MPNNs: first, CTLayer, a layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a relevance function for edge re-weighting; second, GAPLayer, a layer to optimize the spectral gap, depending on the nature of the network and the task at hand. We empirically validate the value of our proposed approach and each of these layers separately with benchmark datasets for graph classification.

DEER is commonly conducted under conditions where the polarization of the spins is small. Here, we examine the DEER signal under conditions of high spin polarization, thermally obtainable at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, and show that the signal acquires a polarization-dependent out-of-phase component both for the intramolecular and intermolecular contributions. For the latter, this corresponds to a phase shift of the spin echo that is linear in the pump pulse position. We derive a compact analytical form of this phase shift and show experimental measurements using monoradical and biradical nitroxides at several fields and temperatures. The effect highlights a novel aspect of the fundamental spin physics underlying DEER spectroscopy.</p>",2022-07-01,2022-07-06 18:54:03,2022-07-06 18:54:03,2022-07-06 18:54:03,101-110,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,mr.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/RMC36KT3/Sweger et al. - 2022 - The effect of spin polarization on double electron.pdf

The findings are consistent across three very different sources of data. Analysis of the first source - large scale administrative data on research teams, team scientific output, and attribution of credit - show that women are significantly less likely to be named on any given article or patent produced by their team relative to their peers. The gender gap in attribution is found across almost all scientific fields and career stages. The second source – an extensive survey of authors – similarly shows that women’s scientific contributions are systematically less likely to be recognized.

Here we develop a method for high-resolution structure determination of minorly populated states by coupling NMR spectroscopy-derived pseudocontact shifts5 (PCSs) with Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion6 (PCS–CPMG). Our approach additionally defines the corresponding kinetics and thermodynamics of high-energy excursions, thereby characterizing the entire free-energy landscape. Using a large set of simulated data for adenylate kinase (Adk), calmodulin and Src kinase, we find that high-energy PCSs accurately determine high-energy structures (with a root mean squared deviation of less than 3.5 angström). Applying our methodology to Adk during catalysis, we find that the high-energy excursion involves surprisingly small openings of the AMP and ATP lids. This previously unresolved high-energy structure solves a longstanding controversy about conformational interconversions that are rate-limiting for catalysis. Primed for either substrate binding or product release, the high-energy structure of Adk suggests a two-step mechanism combining conformational selection to this state, followed by an induced-fit step into a fully closed state for catalysis of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. Unlike other methods for resolving high-energy states, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, our solution PCS–CPMG approach excels in cases involving domain rearrangements of smaller systems (less than 60 kDa) and populations as low as 0.5%, and enables the simultaneous determination of protein structure, kinetics and thermodynamics while proteins perform their function.",2022-03,2022-07-06 19:24:20,2022-07-06 19:24:20,2022-07-06 19:24:20,528-535,,7901,603,,,,,,,,,,en,"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited",,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 7901 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/NU8SCGZN/Stiller et al. - 2022 - Structure determination of high-energy states in a.pdf

It was suggested that large-scale ‘breathing’ motions of the surrounding protein environment would be necessary to accommodate these ring flipping events1. However, the structural details of these motions have remained unclear. Here we uncover the structural rearrangements that accompany ring flipping of a buried tyrosine residue in an SH3 domain. Using NMR, we show that the tyrosine side chain flips to a low-populated, minor state and, through a proteome-wide sequence analysis, we design mutants that stabilize this state, which allows us to capture its high-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. A void volume is generated around the tyrosine ring during the structural transition between the major and minor state, and this allows fast flipping to take place.

The consequent nuclear spectroscopy method is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the chemical environment of certain nuclei. Typically, three types of nuclear interactions may be observed: the isomer shift due to differences in nearby electron densities (also called the chemical shift in older literature), quadrupole splitting due to atomic-scale electric field gradients; and magnetic Zeeman splitting due to non-nuclear magnetic fields. Due to the high energy and extremely narrow line widths of nuclear gamma rays, Mössbauer spectroscopy is a highly sensitive technique in terms of energy (and hence frequency) resolution, capable of detecting changes of just a few parts in 1011.

It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. This contrasts with a conditional distribution, which gives the probabilities contingent upon the values of the other variables. Marginal variables are those variables in the subset of variables being retained. These concepts are ""marginal"" because they can be found by summing values in a table along rows or columns, and writing the sum in the margins of the table. The distribution of the marginal variables (the marginal distribution) is obtained by marginalizing – that is, focusing on the sums in the margin – over the distribution of the variables being discarded, and the discarded variables are said to have been marginalized out. The context here is that the theoretical studies being undertaken, or the data analysis being done, involves a wider set of random variables but that attention is being limited to a reduced number of those variables. In many applications, an analysis may start with a given collection of random variables, then first extend the set by defining new ones (such as the sum of the original random variables) and finally reduce the number by placing interest in the marginal distribution of a subset (such as the sum).

But due to the intrinsic structural flexibility of RNAs, all the three mainstream structure determination methods (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and Cryo-EM) encounter challenges when resolving the RNA structures, which leads to the scarcity of the resolved RNA structures. Computational prediction approaches emerge as complementary to the experimental techniques. However, none of the \textit{de novo} approaches is based on deep learning since too few structures are available. Instead, most of them apply the time-consuming sampling-based strategies, and their performance seems to hit the plateau. In this work, we develop the first end-to-end deep learning approach, E2Efold-3D, to accurately perform the \textit{de novo} RNA structure prediction. Several novel components are proposed to overcome the data scarcity, such as a fully-differentiable end-to-end pipeline, secondary structure-assisted self-distillation, and parameter-efficient backbone formulation. Such designs are validated on the independent, non-overlapping RNA puzzle testing dataset and reach an average sub-4 \AA{} root-mean-square deviation, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

However, these methods neglect the geometric constraints of the complex structure and weaken the role of local functional regions. As a result, they might produce unreasonable conformations for challenging targets and generalize poorly to novel proteins.

In the empirical sciences, the so-called  three-sigma rule of thumb (or 3σ rule) expresses a conventional heuristic that nearly all values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean, and thus it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% probability as near certainty.In the social sciences, a result may be considered ""significant"" if its confidence level is of the order of a two-sigma effect (95%), while in particle physics, there is a convention of a five-sigma effect (99.99994% confidence) being required to qualify as a discovery. A weaker three-sigma rule can be derived from Chebyshev's inequality, stating that even for non-normally distributed variables, at least 88.8% of cases should fall within properly calculated three-sigma intervals. For unimodal distributions, the probability of being within the interval is at least 95% by the Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality. There may be certain assumptions for a distribution that force this probability to be at least 98%.",2022-06-28,2022-07-08 04:36:08,2022-07-08 04:36:13,2022-07-08 04:36:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,Page Version ID: 1095369772,,

Current studies use existing techniques, such as weight constraint, representation constraint, which are derived from images or text data, to transfer the invariant knowledge from the pre-train stage to fine-tuning stage. However, these methods failed to preserve invariances from graph structure and Graph Neural Network (GNN) style models. In this paper, we present a novel optimal transport-based fine-tuning framework called GTOT-Tuning, namely, Graph Topology induced Optimal Transport fine-Tuning, for GNN style backbones. GTOT-Tuning is required to utilize the property of graph data to enhance the preservation of representation produced by fine-tuned networks. Toward this goal, we formulate graph local knowledge transfer as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with a structural prior and construct the GTOT regularizer to constrain the fine-tuned model behaviors. By using the adjacency relationship amongst nodes, the GTOT regularizer achieves node-level optimal transport procedures and reduces redundant transport procedures, resulting in efficient knowledge transfer from the pre-trained models.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K).

We model heme proteins using a hybrid model employing the AWSEM Hamiltonian, a coarse-grained forcefield for the protein chain along with AMBER, an all-atom forcefield for the heme. We carefully designed transferable force fields that model the interactions between the protein and the heme. The types of protein–ligand interactions in the hybrid model include thioester covalent bonds, coordinated covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatics. We explore the influence of different types of hemes (heme b and heme c) on folding and structure prediction. Including both types of heme improves the quality of protein structure predictions. The free energy landscape shows that both types of heme can act as nucleation sites for protein folding and stabilize the protein folded state. In binding the heme, coordinated covalent bonds and thioester covalent bonds for heme c drive the heme toward the native pocket.

Previously, we identified the bona fide fusion peptides (FPs) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (“SARS-1”) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (“SARS-2”) using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. We also found that their FPs induce membrane ordering in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. Here we study which negatively charged residues in SARS-1 FP are involved in this binding, to build a topological model and clarify the role of Ca2+. Our systematic mutation study on the SARS-1 FP shows that all six negatively charged residues contribute to the FP’s membrane ordering activity, with D812 the dominant residue. The corresponding SARS-2 residue D830 plays an equivalent role. We provide a topological model of how the FP binds Ca2+ ions: its two segments FP1 and FP2 each bind one Ca2+. The binding of Ca2+, the folding of FP (both studied by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments), and the ordering activity correlate very well across the mutants, suggesting that the Ca2+ helps the folding of FP in membranes to enhance the ordering activity. Using a novel pseudotyped viral particle-liposome methodology, we monitored the membrane ordering induced by the FPs in the whole spike protein in its trimer form in real time. We found that the SARS-1 and SARS-2 pseudotyped viral particles also induce membrane ordering to the extent that separate FPs do, and mutations of the negatively charged residues also significantly suppress the membrane ordering activity. However, the slower kinetics of the FP ordering activity versus that of the pseudotyped viral particle suggest the need for initial trimerization of the FPs.",2022-01-18,2022-07-08 16:10:45,2022-07-08 16:10:45,2022-07-08 16:10:44,207-227,,2,121,,Biophysical Journal,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/RV8QAZ89/S0006349521039485.html

We present thermodynamics and transition kinetics of these conformational rearrangements and show that paratope states can be used to improve antibody-antigen docking.

The $\varepsilon_n$, for $n=1,2,3,4$, are sensitive to the shape of the colliding ions, characterized by the quadrupole $\beta_2$, octupole $\beta_3$ and hexadecapole $\beta_4$ deformations. This sensitivity is investigated analytically and also in a Monte Carlo Glauber model. One observes a robust linear relation, $\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle = a_n'+b_n'\beta_n^2$, for events in a fixed centrality. The $\langle\varepsilon_1^2\rangle$ has a contribution from $\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$, and $\langle\varepsilon_3^2\rangle$ from $\beta_4$. In the ultra-central collisions, there are little cross contributions between $\beta_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ and between $\beta_3$ and $\varepsilon_2$, but clear cross contributions are present in non-central collisions. Additionally, $\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle$ are insensitive to non-axial shape parameters such as the triaxiality. This is good news because the measurements of $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ can be used to constrain simultaneously the $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$, and $\beta_4$ values. This is best done by comparing two colliding ions with similar mass numbers and therefore nearly identical $a_n'$, to obtain simple equation that relates the $\beta_n$ of the two species. This opens up the possibility to map the shape of the atomic nuclei at a timescale ($<10^{-24}$s) much shorter than probed by low-energy nuclear structure physics ($<10^{-21}$s), which ultimately may provide information complementary to those obtained in the nuclear structure experiments.",2022-01-05,2022-07-08 16:56:11,2022-07-08 16:56:11,2022-07-08 16:56:11,14905,,1,105,,Phys.

The protein design problem belongs to the non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard class as sequence search space increases exponentially with protein length. To ensure better search space exploration and faster convergence, we propose a protein modularity–based parallel protein design algorithm. The modular architecture of the protein structure is exploited by considering an intermediate structural organization between secondary structure and domain defined as protein unit (PU). Here, we have incorporated a divide-and-conquer approach where a protein is split into PUs and each PU region is explored in a parallel fashion. It has been further analyzed that our shared memory implementation of modularity-based parallel sequence search leads to better search space exploration compared to the case of traditional full protein design. Sequence-based analysis on design sequences depicts an average of 39.7% sequence similarity on the benchmark data set. Structure-based comparison of the modeled structures of the design protein with the target structure exhibited an average root-mean-square deviation of 1.17 Å and an average template modeling score of 0.89. The selected modeled structures of the design protein sequences are validated using 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations where 80% of the proteins have shown better or similar stability to the respective target proteins.

A recent replica-exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on holo CaM/4Ca2+ suggested the existence of distinct structural clusters (substates) along the path from extended to compact conformers in the absence of substrates. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of CaM/4Ca2+ substates trapped in local minima by three freezing/annealing regimes (slow, 40 s; intermediate, 1.5 s; fast, 0.5 ms) using pulsed Q-band double electron−electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy to measure interdomain distances between nitroxide spinlabels positioned at A17C and A128C in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The DEER echo curves were directly ﬁt to population-optimized P(r) pairwise distance distributions calculated from the coordinates of the MD clusters and compact crystal structure. DEER data on fully deuterated CaM/4Ca2+ were acquired at multiple values of the second echo period (10−35 μs) and analyzed globally to eliminate instrumental and overﬁtting artifacts and ensure accurate populations, peak positions, and widths. The DEER data for all three freezing regimes are quantitatively accounted for within experimental error by 5−6 distinct conformers comprising a predominantly populated extended form (60−75%) and progressively more compact states whose populations decrease as the degree of compactness increases. The shortest interdomain separation is found in the compact crystal structure, which has an occupancy of 4−6%.

In particular, the design of ArMs by the supramolecular anchoring of metal catalysts to protein hosts provides flexible and easy to optimise systems. The use of cofactor dependent enzymes as hosts gives the advantage of both a (hydrophobic) binding site for the substrate and a cofactor pocket to accommodate the catalyst. Here, we present a computationally driven design approach of ArMs for the transfer hydrogenation reaction of cyclic imines, starting from the NADP               +               -dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from               Thermoanaerobacter brockii               (TbADH). We tested and developed a molecular docking workflow to define and optimize iridium catalysts with high affinity for the cofactor binding site of TbADH. The workflow uses high throughput docking of compound libraries to identify key structural motifs for high affinity, followed by higher accuracy docking methods on smaller, focused ligand and catalyst libraries. Iridium sulfonamide catalysts were selected and synthesised, containing either a triol, a furane, or a carboxylic acid to provide the interaction with the cofactor binding pocket. IC               50               values of the resulting complexes during TbADH-catalysed alcohol oxidation were determined by competition experiments and were between 4.410 mM and 0.052 mM, demonstrating the affinity of the iridium complexes for either the substrate or the cofactor binding pocket of TbADH. The catalytic activity of the free iridium complexes in solution showed a maximal turnover number (TON) of 90 for the reduction of salsolidine by the triol-functionalised iridium catalyst, whilst in the presence of TbADH, only the iridium catalyst with the triol anchoring functionality showed activity for the same reaction (TON of 36 after 24 h). The observation that the artificial metalloenzymes developed here lacked stereoselectivity demonstrates the need for the further investigation and optimisation of the ArM. Our results serve as a starting point for the design of robust artificial metalloenzymes, exploiting supramolecular anchoring to natural NAD(P)H binding pockets.",2022,2022-07-10 01:10:38,2022-07-10 01:10:38,2022-07-10 01:10:38,315-335,,,234,,Faraday Discuss.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/JLK3TZPZ/Martins et al. - 2022 - Computationally driven design of an artificial met.pdf

Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising computational approach that may eventually yield comparable problem-solving behaviour in artificial agents and robots. However, so far, the problem-solving abilities of many human and non-human animals are clearly superior to those of artificial systems. Here we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired hierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial agents. We first review the literature in cognitive psychology to highlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive processing. Then we relate the gained insights with contemporary hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. Interestingly, our results suggest that all identified cognitive mechanisms have been implemented individually in isolated computational architectures, raising the question of why there exists no single unifying architecture that integrates them. As our final contribution, we address this question by providing an integrative perspective on the computational challenges to develop such a unifying architecture.

These constitute a sensitive probe of the microstructure and are described by the Bloch-Torrey equations. An NMR simulation framework based on an augmented lattice Boltzmann method aimed at the fine-scale resolution of nuclear polarization density is presented. The approach encapsulates the time evolution of the full magnetization vector and naturally incorporates the mechanisms of diffusional transport. Spin dephasing mechanisms are fully resolved at tomogram voxel scale to account for magnetic field inhomogeneity. The approach is validated against analytical solutions of spin-echo decays for simple pore geometries. An application to a nano-computed-tomography image of chalk with inhomogeneous internal fields yields T2 spectral measures in good agreement with experiment and illustrates the spatial pore-scale dynamics of net magnetization.

Inspired from their use in other machine-learning applications, NNP ensembles have been used for uncertainty prediction in several studies, with the caveat that ensembles do not provide a rigorous Bayesian estimate of the uncertainty. To test whether NNP ensembles provide accurate uncertainty estimates, we train such ensembles in four different case studies and compare the predicted uncertainty with the errors on out-of-distribution validation sets. Our results indicate that NNP ensembles are often overconfident, underestimating the uncertainty of the model, and require to be calibrated for each system and architecture.

We demonstrate this approach on two different systems, the analytic van der Waals EOS and published data for the Lennard-Jones fluid, and we show that it is advantageous over direct learning of thermodynamic properties (i.e., not as derivatives of the free energy but as independent properties), in terms of both accuracy and the exact preservation of the Maxwell relations.

The model learns solutions that satisfy, up to an arbitrarily small error, Hamilton's equations and, therefore, conserve the Hamiltonian invariants.

Although the plastid underwent rapid evolution by genome reduction, its genome organisation is highly conserved and the rate of molecular evolution of its genes is low. Here, we investigate the factors that have constrained the rate of molecular evolution of protein coding genes in the plastid genome. Through phylogenomic analysis of 773 angiosperm plastid genomes we show that there is substantial variation in the rate of molecular evolution between genes. We demonstrate that the distance of a plastid gene from the origin of replication influences the rate at which it has evolved, consistent with time and distance-dependent nucleotide mutation gradients. We further show that the amino acid composition of a gene product constraints its substitution tolerance, limiting its mutation landscape and its corresponding rate of molecular evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the mRNA abundance of a gene is a critical factor in determining its rate of molecular evolution, suggesting the presence of transcription mediated DNA repair in the plastid. Collectively, we show that the location, composition, and expression of a gene account for ~50% of the variation in its rate of molecular evolution. Thus, these three factors are a major limitation on the capacity for adaptive evolution of plastid genes, and ultimately constrain the evolvability of the chloroplast.",2022-07-12,2022-07-15 04:33:50,2022-07-15 04:33:50,2022-07-15 04:33:50,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The energy transfer from the LHCIIs to the PSII core complexes becomes less efficient, whereas the excitation level of PSI increases. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra showed an increase in delayed PSI fluorescence, which represents energetical spillover from PSII to PSI. In addition, the spillover is likely mediated by phospho-LHCIIs and PSI antennas.

More recently, attention has been given to the differential impact of distinct pollinators on gene flow, with the goal of developing isolation distances associated with specific managed pollinators. To examine the differential impact of bee species on gene movement, we quantified the relationship between the probability of getting a GE seed in a pod, and the order in which a flower was visited, or the cumulative distance travelled by a bee in a foraging bout. We refer to these relationships as ‘seed curves’ and compare these seeds curves among three bee species. The experiments used Medicago sativa L. plants carrying three copies of the glyphosate resistance (GR) allele as pollen donors, such that each pollen grain carried the GR allele, and conventional plants as pollen recipients. Different foraging metrics, including the number of GR seeds produced over a foraging bout, were also quantified and contrasted among bee species. Leafcutting bees produced the lowest number of GR genes in a foraging bout, and moved them the shortest distances, bumble bees the longest. Values for honey bees were intermediate. Seed curves correlated with field-based gene flow estimates. Thus, differential seed curves of bee species, reflecting within foraging bout patterns, translated into distinct abilities of bee species to move genes at a landscape level. Differences in seed curves reflected differences in foraging behavior among bee species, and helped explain their differential impact on gene flow and the spread of GE genes in insect-pollinated crops.",2022-07-10,2022-07-15 04:34:41,2022-07-15 04:34:41,2022-07-15 04:34:41,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Although rubisco is the source of most carbon in the biosphere, it is a surprisingly inefficient catalyst with a modest carboxylase turnover rate and a competing oxygenase activity which results in the loss of fixed CO2. These apparent shortcomings of rubisco present a puzzling evolutionary paradox: why does the enzyme appear well suited to the high CO2 low O2 conditions of its origin, rather than the low CO2 high O2 conditions of the present day? To help answer this question, we perform a phylogenetically resolved analysis of the molecular and kinetic evolution of Form I rubisco. We discover that rubisco is among the slowest evolving genes on Earth. Specifically, we find that the rubisco catalytic large subunit evolves substantially slower than its cognate small subunit, and is slower than >98% of all other genes and enzymes across the tree of life. Next, through simultaneous analysis of rubisco molecular and kinetic evolution in C3 angiosperms, we demonstrate that despite its slow molecular evolution, rubisco kinetics have evolved, and are continuing to evolve, to improve CO2/O2 specificity, carboxylase turnover and overall carboxylation efficiency. Thus, slow molecular evolution has severely limited rubisco kinetic optimisation, resulting in the present enzyme that is poorly adapted for current conditions.",2022-07-06,2022-07-15 04:36:11,2022-07-15 04:36:11,2022-07-15 04:36:11,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We present a method to measure the complexity of plant leaf shapes by relating their fractal dimensions to topological entropy. Our method relies on ‘segmental fractal complexity’ and stems from a fractal-thermodynamic system analogy. The complexity of plant leaf shapes is an algebraic combination of the fractal dimensions of the components of the leaf-image system. We applied this method to leaf forms of 30 tropical plant species. While topological entropy is positively correlated with the leaf dissection index, it is an improvement over the leaf dissection index because of its ability to capture the spatial positioning of the leaf lamina, the leaf edges, and the leaf background. The topological entropy method is also an advancement over conventional geometric and fractal dimension-based measures of leaf complexity because it does not entail information loss due to the pre-processing and is perceptibly simple.",2022-07-05,2022-07-15 04:37:27,2022-07-15 04:37:27,2022-07-15 04:37:27,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Most previous methods struggle with generality, simplicity, and expressiveness — some are designed ad hoc for speciﬁc data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacriﬁce ﬂexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework to achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing (graph neural network) scheme. We ﬁnd the equivariant property could be obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud. Therefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors of a point, the networks transforms the neighbors’ coordinates based on the point’s learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance of the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks.

A key problem is that the question of how living organisms can exhibit self-organizing ability that leads to highly ordered structures and active free independent behavior remains unanswered. This work reveals, by computer simulation and experiments, that a stationary or near-stationary state of an open reaction network (ORN) demonstrates such self-organizing ability. Reaction and diffusion processes are always forced toward equilibrium and consequently, a stationary state of an ORN is firmly stabilized by these processes; specifically, it attains dynamic self-organization. A non-equilibrium stationary state also has a property of approaching equilibrium, or evolving toward a high-efficiency ordered system. Moreover, a stationary state can demonstrate free independent behavior. Thus, a stationary state of an ORN can be regarded as a precursor of primitive life, and dynamic self-organization in it provides a fundamental principle for the emergence of life.",2022-06-29,2022-07-15 05:04:01,2022-07-15 05:04:01,2022-07-15 05:04:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,chemrxiv.org,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/6DC9RBGB/Yoshiharu Mukouyama et al. - 2022 - Dynamic Self-organization in an Open Reaction Netw.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/A6YF75P5/62bbef4452acb7716a77561f.html

Hydrogen bond acidity is reviewed and it is shown how polarity can be estimated for individual hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from alkane/water partition coefficient measurements. Hydrogen bond donors are generally less polar than hydrogen bond acceptors and desolvation penalty is therefore an implausible explanation for deleterious effects of hydrogen bond donors. Generally, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors in organic compounds exceeds the number of hydrogen bond donors and the apparently greater restrictiveness of the Rule of 5 for hydrogen bond donors may simply be a reflection of this imbalance. The weaker hydration of hydrogen bond donors implies that attempts to address polarity surfeit in optimization of permeability should be focused on hydrogen bond acceptors. Elimination of redundant hydrogen bond donors can potentially reduce active efflux and destabilize the solid state without resulting in unacceptable increases in lipophilicity. The key hydrogen bond donor-acceptor asymmetry in the context of target recognition is that the presence of a hydrogen bond donor usually implies that a hydrogen bond acceptor is also present. Target-ligand hydrogen bonds form in aqueous media and design opportunities presented by frustrated hydration and secondary interactions are discussed.

This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance.

In this paper, we introduce a new task named molecule manipulation, which aims to align the molecular properties of the generated molecule and its latent activation in order to achieve interactive molecule editing. Then we develop a method called Chemical Space Explorer (ChemSpacE), which identifies and traverses interpretable directions in the latent space that align with molecular structures and property changes. Specifically, ChemSpacE leverages the properties of the learned latent space by generative models and utilizes linear models to identify such directions and thus is highly efficient in terms of training/inference time, data, and the number of oracle calls.

Although studies have focused on the G-protein signaling state, the mechanism for β-arrestin signaling by CB1 is not yet well defined. Studies have indicated that transmembrane helix 7 (TMH7) and the highly conserved NPXXY motif can be subject to different conformational changes in response to biased ligands and could therefore participate in a molecular mechanism to trigger β-arrestin recruitment. Objective: To investigate the effect of mutations in the NPXXY motif on different signaling pathways activated by the CB1 receptor. Materials and Methods: Point mutations of the NPXXY motif and associated residues were generated in the CB1 receptor using site-directed mutagenesis and transfection into HEK-293 cells. Signaling by wild-type and mutant receptors was analyzed by quantifying inhibition of cAMP, and by β-arrestin recruitment assays. Results: We found that N7.49 and Y7.53 are essential for β-arrestin recruitment by CB1. N7.49A and Y7.53F impair β-arrestin signaling, with no effect on G-protein signaling. We found a regulatory role for residue I2.43; I2.43 interacts with Y7.53, affecting its positioning. Reducing steric bulk at I2.43 (I2.43A) enhances β-arrestin1 recruitment, while introducing a polar residue (I2.43T) reduces β-arrestin recruitment. Conclusions: These findings point to a novel mechanism for β-arrestin recruitment, implicating amino acids in the NPXXY motif as critical for the putative β-arrestin biased conformational state of Class A GPCRs.",2022-07-06,2022-07-19 05:56:24,2022-07-19 05:56:32,2022-07-19 05:56:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,liebertpub.com (Atypon),,"Publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers",,

This review outlines the ways in which information about the underlying energy landscape of a protein can be extracted from X-ray crystallographic data, with an emphasis on new developments in XFEL and synchrotron time-resolved crystallography.

Nevertheless, challenges remain as few computational methods are available to effectively predict allosteric sites, identify signalling pathways involved in allostery, or to aid with the design of suitable molecules targeting such sites. Recently, bond-to-bond propensity analysis has been shown successful at identifying allosteric sites for a large and diverse group of proteins from knowledge of the orthosteric sites and its ligands alone by using network analysis applied to energy-weighted atomistic protein graphs. To address the identification of signalling pathways, we propose here a method to compute and score paths of optimised propensity that link the orthosteric site with the identified allosteric sites, and identifies crucial residues that contribute to those paths. We showcase the approach with three well-studied allosteric proteins: h-Ras, caspase-1, and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Key residues in both orthosteric and allosteric sites were identified and showed agreement with experimental results, and pivotal signalling residues along the pathway were also revealed, thus providing alternative targets for drug design. By using the computed path scores, we were also able to differentiate the activity of different allosteric modulators.",2022-07-14,2022-07-19 15:59:51,2022-07-19 15:59:52,2022-07-19 15:59:51,167749,,,,,Journal of Molecular Biology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/2WEJZF3X/S0022283622003515.html

While there have been considerable advances, our ability to generate new proteins in the laboratory is seemingly limited. One explanation for these shortcomings may be that insertions and deletions (indels), which frequently arise in nature, are largely overlooked during protein engineering campaigns. The profound effect of indels on protein structures, by way of drastic backbone alterations, could be perceived as “saltation” events that bring about significant phenotypic changes in a single mutational step. Should we leverage these effects to accelerate protein engineering and gain access to unexplored regions of adaptive landscapes? In this Perspective, we describe the role played by indels in the functional diversification of proteins in nature and discuss their untapped potential for protein engineering, despite their often-destabilizing nature.

Theoretically and numerically, we show that the disease persistence depends on ℛ 0 . We carry out a local and global sensitivity analysis. The local sensitivity analysis shows that the most positive sensitive parameter is the recruitment rate, followed by the relative transmissibility rate from the infectious with delayed diagnosis to the susceptible individuals.

The global sensitivity analysis using the partial rank correlation coefficient confirms the directional flow of the local sensitivity analysis.

The major problem with data-driven vulnerability repair is that the few existing datasets of known confirmed vulnerabilities consist of only a few thousand examples. However, training a deep learning model often requires hundreds of thousands of examples. In this work, we leverage the intuition that the bug fixing task and the vulnerability fixing task are related and that the knowledge learned from bug fixes can be transferred to fixing vulnerabilities. In the machine learning community, this technique is called transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an approach for repairing security vulnerabilities named VRepair which is based on transfer learning. VRepair is first trained on a large bug fix corpus and is then tuned on a vulnerability fix dataset, which is an order of magnitude smaller. In our experiments, we show that a model trained only on a bug fix corpus can already fix some vulnerabilities. Then, we demonstrate that transfer learning improves the ability to repair vulnerable C functions. We also show that the transfer learning model performs better than a model trained with a denoising task and fine-tuned on the vulnerability fixing task.

With increasing demand for high-throughput, high-resolution cryoEM services comes greater demand for rapid and automated cryoEM grid and sample screening. During screening, optimal grids and sample conditions are identified for subsequent high-resolution data collection. Screening is a major bottleneck for new cryoEM projects because grids must be optimized over several factors, including grid type, grid hole size, sample concentration, buffer conditions, ice thickness, and particle behaviors. Even for mature projects, multiple grids are commonly screened to select a subset for high-resolution data collection. Here, machine learning and novel, purpose-built image processing and microscope-handling algorithms are incorporated into the automated data collection software, Leginon, to provide an open-source solution for fully automated, high-throughput grid screening. This new version, broadly called Smart Leginon, emulates the actions of an operator in identifying areas on the grid to explore as potentially useful for data collection. Smart Leginon Autoscreen sequentially loads and examines grids from an automated specimen exchange system to provide completely unattended grid screening across a set of grids. Comparisons between a multi-grid Autoscreen session and conventional manual screening by five expert microscope operators are presented. On average, Autoscreen reduces operator time from ∼6 hours to <10 minutes and provides a comparable percentage of suitable images for evaluation as the best operator. Smart Leginon’s ability to target holes that are particularly difficult to identify is analyzed. Finally, Smart Leginon’s utility is illustrated with three real-world multi-grid user screening/collection sessions, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of the software package. Smart Leginon’s fully automated functionality significantly reduces the burden on operator screening time, improves the throughput of screening, and recovers idle microscope time, thereby improving availability of cryoEM services.",2022-07-23,2022-07-28 15:50:16,2022-07-28 15:50:16,2022-07-28 15:50:16,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Geometry optimization steps are chosen using the restricted step partitioned rational function optimization method, and displacements are realized using a high-performance geodesic stepping algorithm.

This work introduces a simple, lightweight, and efficient framework for single-image haze removal, exploiting rich ""dark-knowledge"" information from a lightweight pre-trained super-resolution model via the notion of heterogeneous knowledge distillation.

This premise led to a proliferation of methods offering techniques to learn and predict labels together, for example where the prediction for one label influences predictions for other labels. Even though it is now acknowledged that in many contexts a model of dependence is not required for optimal performance, such models continue to outperform independent models in some of those very contexts, suggesting alternative explanations for their performance beyond label dependence, which the literature is only recently beginning to unravel. Leveraging and extending recent discoveries, we turn the original premise of multi-label learning on its head, and approach the problem of joint-modeling specifically under the absence of any measurable dependence among task labels; for example, when task labels come from separate problem domains. We shift insights from this study towards building an approach for transfer learning that challenges the long-held assumption that transferability of tasks comes from measurements of similarity between the source and target domains or models. This allows us to design and test a method for transfer learning, which is model driven rather than purely data driven, and furthermore it is black box and model-agnostic (any base model class can be considered). We show that essentially we can create task-dependence based on source-model capacity.

However, the performance of deep learning is likely to impede in face of non-IID situations. Domain generalization (DG) enables a model to generalize to an unseen test distribution, i.e., to learn domain-invariant representations. In this paper, we argue that domain-invariant features should be originating from both internal and mutual sides. Internal invariance means that the features can be learned with a single domain and the features capture intrinsic semantics of data, i.e., the property within a domain, which is agnostic to other domains. Mutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains (cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the transferable features w.r.t. other domains. We then propose DIFEX for Domain-Invariant Feature EXploration. DIFEX employs a knowledge distillation framework to capture the high-level Fourier phase as the internally-invariant features and learn cross-domain correlation alignment as the mutually-invariant features. We further design an exploration loss to increase the feature diversity for better generalization.

By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, over-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices over the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication cost of FL. In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and traditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network. We propose a coexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication framework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an OFDM system. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee a given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource allocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the coexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication between the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the challenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication ratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The analysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio that minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to converge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a low-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource allocation for both the FL devices and IT devices. Extensive numerical simulations verify the superior performance of the proposed design for the coexistence of FL and IT devices in wireless cellular systems.",2022-07-26,2022-07-29 15:42:33,2022-07-29 15:42:33,2022-07-29 15:42:33,,,,,,,CFLIT,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2207.12884 [cs, math]",,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/S898ZVYZ/Lin et al. - 2022 - CFLIT Coexisting Federated Learning and Informati.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/7HBFKH7Z/2207.html

Passive grippers are used because they offer interesting trade-offs between cost and capabilities. However, existing designs are limited in the types of shapes that can be grasped. This work proposes to use rapid-manufacturing and design optimization to expand the space of shapes that can be passively grasped. Our novel generative design algorithm takes in an object and its positioning with respect to a robotic arm and generates a 3D printable passive gripper that can stably pick the object up. To achieve this, we address the key challenge of jointly optimizing the shape and the insert trajectory to ensure a passively stable grasp.

Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment.

These compute classifiers by different approaches, differing in the degree of statistical modelling. Terminology is inconsistent, but three major types can be distinguished, following Jebara (2004): A generative model is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution                         P         (         X         ,         Y         )                 {\displaystyle P(X,Y)}    on given observable variable X and target variable Y; A discriminative model is a model of the conditional probability                         P         (         Y         ∣         X         =         x         )                 {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X=x)}    of the target Y, given an observation x; and Classifiers computed without using a probability model are also referred to loosely as ""discriminative"".The distinction between these last two classes is not consistently made; Jebara (2004) refers to these three classes as generative learning, conditional learning, and discriminative learning, but Ng & Jordan (2002) only distinguish two classes, calling them generative classifiers (joint distribution) and discriminative classifiers (conditional distribution or no distribution), not distinguishing between the latter two classes. Analogously, a classifier based on a generative model is a generative classifier, while a classifier based on a discriminative model is a discriminative classifier, though this term also refers to classifiers that are not based on a model. Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are: generative classifiers: naive Bayes classifier and linear discriminant analysis discriminative model: logistic regressionIn application to classification, one wishes to go from an observation x to a label y (or probability distribution on labels). One can compute this directly, without using a probability distribution (distribution-free classifier); one can estimate the probability of a label given an observation,                         P         (         Y                    |                  X         =         x         )                 {\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)}    (discriminative model), and base classification on that; or one can estimate the joint distribution                         P         (         X         ,         Y         )                 {\displaystyle P(X,Y)}    (generative model), from that compute the conditional probability                         P         (         Y                    |                  X         =         x         )                 {\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)}   , and then base classification on that. These are increasingly indirect, but increasingly probabilistic, allowing more domain knowledge and probability theory to be applied. In practice different approaches are used, depending on the particular problem, and hybrids can combine strengths of multiple approaches.",2022-06-30,2022-08-03 19:37:35,2022-08-03 19:37:48,2022-08-03 19:37:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,Page Version ID: 1095756341,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/AELB4AFY/Generative_model.html

In this paper, we present a novel optimal transport-based fine-tuning framework called GTOT-Tuning, namely, Graph Topology induced Optimal Transport fine-Tuning, for GNN style backbones. GTOT-Tuning is required to utilize the property of graph data to enhance the preservation of representation produced by fine-tuned networks. Toward this goal, we formulate graph local knowledge transfer as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with a structural prior and construct the GTOT regularizer to constrain the fine-tuned model behaviors. By using the adjacency relationship amongst nodes, the GTOT regularizer achieves node-level optimal transport procedures and reduces redundant transport procedures, resulting in efficient knowledge transfer from the pre-trained models.

Most GNNs use a message passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising results, MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing and under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the literature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most state-of-the-art graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of the graph, are not differentiable (inductive) and require the tuning of hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose DiffWire, a novel framework for graph rewiring in MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and parameter-free by leveraging the Lov\'asz bound. Our approach provides a unified theory for graph rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers in MPNNs: first, CTLayer, a layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a relevance function for edge re-weighting; second, GAPLayer, a layer to optimize the spectral gap, depending on the nature of the network and the task at hand.

Selection-induced sequence convergence and limited sequencing depth further constrain experimentally observable sequence space. To address these limitations, we integrate experimental and machine learning approaches to explore regions of sequence space unrelated to experimentally derived variants. We perform in vitro selections to discover highly side-chain-functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) with potent affinities for a target small molecule (daunomycin KD = 5–65 nM). We then use the selection data to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) machine learning model to generate diverse and unique HFNAP sequences with high daunomycin affinities (KD = 9–26 nM), even though they are unrelated in sequence to experimental polymers.

The continuous developments in protein science, increasing computing power, new algorithms, and characterization techniques provide sophisticated toolkits for solubility design beyond guess work. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the protein design field with respect to water solubility and structural stability. After introducing fundamental design rules, we discuss the transmembrane protein solubilization and de novo transmembrane protein design. Traditional strategies to enhance protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The designs of stable protein complexes and high-order assemblies are covered. Computational methodologies behind these endeavors, including structure prediction programs, machine learning algorithms, and specialty software dedicated to the evaluation of protein solubility and aggregation, are discussed.

Although techniques to overcome the diffraction barrier were introduced more than two decades ago, and the nominal attainable resolution kept improving to reach single-digit nm, fluorescence microscopy still fails to image the morphology of single proteins or small molecular complexes, either purified or in a cellular context. Here we report a solution to this problem, in the form of one-nanometer expansion (ONE) microscopy. We combined the 10-fold axial expansion of the specimen (1000-fold by volume) with a fluorescence fluctuation analysis to achieve resolutions down to 1 nm or better. We have successfully applied ONE microscopy to image cultured cells, tissues, viral particles, molecular complexes and single proteins. At the cellular level, using immunostaining, our technology revealed detailed nanoscale arrangements of synaptic proteins, including a quasi-regular organisation of PSD95 clusters. At the single molecule level, upon main chain fluorescent labelling, we could visualise the shape of individual membrane and soluble proteins. Moreover, conformational changes undergone by the ~17 kDa protein calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding were readily observable. We could also image and classify molecular aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid samples from Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, which represents a promising new development towards an improved PD diagnosis.

Then we present the method with a simple adaptive search procedure allowing an automatic adjustment to the problem class with the best global complexity bounds, without knowing specific parameters of the problem. In particular, for the class of functions with Lipschitz continuous third derivative, we get the global $O(1/k^3)$ rate, which was previously attributed to third-order tensor methods. When the objective function is uniformly convex, we justify an automatic acceleration of our scheme, resulting in a faster global rate and local superlinear convergence.

From extensive tests, we show that the calculation of accurate kinetics not only requires the transition state to be bias-free, but the amount of bias deposited should also not exceed the effective barrier height measured along the chosen collective variables. In this vein, the possibility of computing rates from biasing suboptimal order parameters has also been explored.

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

In two examples—using direct inspection of bond bundle regional properties, and using correlations between those properties and reaction barrier height—we arrive at similar conclusions, that catalytic enhancement results from promoting electron density redistribution between bonds within the KSI-docked substrate molecule in a way that closely resembles our mechanistic understanding of the forward catalyzed reaction.

We describe protein backbone structure as a series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent amino acid residues, and generate new structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this mirror how proteins biologically twist into energetically favorable conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this representation crucially alleviates the need for complex equivariant networks.

NeuralPLexer jointly samples protein and small-molecule 3D coordinates at an atomistic resolution through a generative model that incorporates biophysical constraints and inferred proximity information into a time-truncated diffusion process. The reverse-time generative diffusion process is learned by a novel stereochemistry-aware equivariant graph transformer that enables efﬁcient, concurrent gradient ﬁeld prediction for all heavy atoms in the protein-ligand complex. NeuralPLexer outperforms existing physics-based and learning-based methods on benchmarking problems including ﬁxed-backbone blind protein-ligand docking and ligand-coupled binding site repacking.

Our key finding is that relaxation using forces from a learned potential yields structures with similar or lower energy to those relaxed using the RPBE functional in over 50\% of evaluated systems, despite the fact that the predicted forces differ significantly from the ground truth. This has the surprising implication that learned potentials may be ready for replacing DFT in challenging catalytic systems such as those found in the Open Catalyst 2020 dataset. Furthermore, we show that a force field trained on a locally harmonic energy surface with the same minima as a target DFT energy is also able to find lower or similar energy structures in over 50\% of cases. This ``Easy Potential'' converges in fewer steps than a standard model trained on true energies and forces, which further accelerates calculations. Its success illustrates a key point: learned potentials can locate energy minima even when the model has high force errors. The main requirement for structure optimisation is simply that the learned potential has the correct minima.

Nonetheless, its potential in even small proteins is inherently limited by the astronomical number of possible amino acid sequences. Sampling the complete sequence space of a 100-residue protein would require testing of 20100 combinations, which is beyond any existing experimental approach. In practice, selective modification of relatively few residues is sufficient for efficient improvement, functional enhancement and repurposing of existing proteins5. Moreover, computational methods have been developed to predict the locations and, in certain cases, identities of potentially productive mutations6–9. Importantly, all current approaches for prediction of hot spots and productive mutations rely heavily on structural information and/or bioinformatics, which is not always available for proteins of interest. Moreover, they offer a limited ability to identify beneficial mutations far from the active site, even though such changes may markedly improve the catalytic properties of an enzyme10. Machine learning methods have recently showed promise in predicting productive mutations11, but they frequently require large, high-quality training datasets, which are difficult to obtain in directed evolution experiments. Here we show that mutagenic hot spots in enzymes can be identified using NMR spectroscopy. In a proof-of-concept study, we converted myoglobin, a non-enzymatic oxygen storage protein, into a highly efficient Kemp eliminase using only three mutations. The observed levels of catalytic efficiency exceed those of proteins designed using current approaches and are similar with those of natural enzymes for the reactions that they are evolved to catalyse.

Owing to its pivotal role played in protein folding patterns, comprehension of protein structure is a challenging issue. Moreover, owing to numerous protein sequence exploration in protein data banks and complication of protein structures, experimental methods are found to be inadequate for protein structural class prediction. Hence, it is very much advantageous to design a reliable computational method to predict protein structural classes from protein sequences. In the recent few years there has been an elevated interest in using deep learning to assist protein structure prediction as protein structure prediction models can be utilized to screen a large number of novel sequences. In this regard, we propose a model employing Energy Profile for atom pairs in conjunction with the Legion-Class Bayes function called Energy Profile Legion-Class Bayes Protein Structure Identification model. Followed by this, we use a Thompson Optimized convolutional neural network to extract features between amino acids and then the Thompson Optimized SoftMax function is employed to extract associations between protein sequences for predicting secondary protein structure.

Developing this technology is hindered by the genetic and biochemical complexity of nitrogenase biosynthesis. Nitrogenase and many of the accessory proteins involved in its assembly and function are O2 sensitive and only sparingly soluble in non-native hosts. We generated transgenic rice plants expressing the nitrogenase structural component, Fe protein (NifH), which carries a [4Fe-4S] cluster in its active form. NifH from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus was targeted to mitochondria together with the putative peptidyl prolyl cis‐trans isomerase NifM from Azotobacter vinelandii to assist in NifH polypeptide folding. The isolated NifH was partially active in electron transfer to the MoFe protein nitrogenase component (NifDK) and in the biosynthesis of the nitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), two fundamental roles for NifH in N2 fixation. NifH functionality was, however, limited by poor [4Fe-4S] cluster occupancy, highlighting the importance of in vivo [Fe-S] cluster insertion and stability to achieve biological N2 fixation in planta.

Owing to its pivotal role played in protein folding patterns, comprehension of protein structure is a challenging issue. Moreover, owing to numerous protein sequence exploration in protein data banks and complication of protein structures, experimental methods are found to be inadequate for protein structural class prediction. Hence, it is very much advantageous to design a reliable computational method to predict protein structural classes from protein sequences. In the recent few years there has been an elevated interest in using deep learning to assist protein structure prediction as protein structure prediction models can be utilized to screen a large number of novel sequences. In this regard, we propose a model employing Energy Profile for atom pairs in conjunction with the Legion-Class Bayes function called Energy Profile Legion-Class Bayes Protein Structure Identification model. Followed by this, we use a Thompson Optimized convolutional neural network to extract features between amino acids and then the Thompson Optimized SoftMax function is employed to extract associations between protein sequences for predicting secondary protein structure.

There are three proposals for the status of the Fe2–S2B–Fe6 bridge during the catalytic cycle: one that it remains intact, another that it is completely labile and absent during catalysis, and a third that S2B is hemilabile, unhooking one of its bonds to Fe2 or Fe6. This report examines the tethered unhooking of S2B and factors that affect it, using DFT calculations of 50 geometric/electronic possibilities with a 485 atom model including all relevant parts of surrounding protein. The outcomes are: (a) unhooking the S2B–Fe2 bond is feasible and favourable, but alternative unhooking of the S2B–Fe6 bond is unlikely for steric reasons, (b) energy differences between hooked and unhooked isomers are generally <10 kcal mol−1, usually with unhooked more stable, (c) ligation at the exo-Fe6 position inhibits unhooking, (d) unhooking of hydrogenated S2B is more favourable than that of bare S2B, (e) hydrogen bonding from the NεH function of His195 to S2B occurs in hooked and unhooked forms, and possibly stabilises unhooking, (f) unhooking is reversible with kinetic barriers ranging 10–13 kcal mol−1. The conclusion is that energetically accessible reversible unhooking of S2B or S2BH, as an intrinsic property of FeMo-co, needs to be considered in the formulation of mechanisms for the reactions of nitrogenase.",2022-09-28,2022-10-11 15:46:54,2022-10-11 15:46:54,2022-10-11 15:46:54,,,,,,Dalton Trans.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,pubs.rsc.org,,Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/WB5VUJ6T/unauth.html; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/ZZVVT9S6/Dance - 2022 - Understanding the tethered unhooking and rehooking.pdf

In this work, we present a new diffusion-based generative model that designs protein backbone structures via a procedure that mirrors the native folding process. We describe protein backbone structure as a series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent amino acid residues, and generate new structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this mirror how proteins biologically twist into energetically favorable conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this representation crucially alleviates the need for complex equivariant networks. We train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a simple transformer backbone and demonstrate that our resulting model unconditionally generates highly realistic protein structures with complexity and structural patterns akin to those of naturally-occurring proteins.

Using ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, photoexcitation of D–A single cocrystals, where D is coronene (Cor) or pyrene (Pyr) and A is N,N-bis(3′-pentyl)-perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (C5PDI) or naphthalene-1,4:5,8-tetracarboxydianhydride (NDA), results in formation of the charge transfer (CT) excitons Cor•+-C5PDI•–, Pyr•+-C5PDI•–, Cor•+-NDA•–, and Pyr•+-NDA•– in <300 fs, while triplet exciton formation occurs in τ = 125, 106, 484, and 958 ps, respectively. TDDFT calculations show that the SOCT-ISC rates correlate with charge delocalization in the CT exciton state. In addition, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that Cor•+-C5PDI•– and Pyr•+-C5PDI•– recombine to form localized 3*C5PDI excitons with zero-field splittings of |D| = 1170 and 1250 MHz, respectively. In contrast, Cor•+-NDA•– and Pyr•+-NDA•– give triplet excitons in which |D| is only 1240 and 690 MHz, respectively, compared to that of NDA (2091 MHz), which is the lowest energy localized triplet exciton, indicating that the Cor-NDA and Pyr-NDA triplet excitons have significant CT character.

Opposite charges experience the powerful force of Coulombic attraction and have the ability to exert fundamental influence on the outcome of reactions that involve charged reagents, intermediates or catalysts. In this Perspective, we will examine how ion-pairing interactions have been used to control selectivity in C–H bond functionalization processes. This broad class of reactions provides an interesting and thought-provoking lens through which to examine the application of ion-pairing design strategies because it is one that encompasses great mechanistic diversity, poses significant selectivity challenges, and perhaps most importantly is of immense interest to synthetic chemists in both industry and academia.

The optimization approaches are embedded in individual modules, which can also be combined for setting up more elaborate strain design problems. Advanced features, such as the efficient integration of GPR rules and the possibility to consider gene and reaction additions or regulatory interventions, have been generalized and are available for all modules. The package uses state-of-the-art preprocessing methods, supports multiple solvers and provides a number of enhanced tools for analyzing computed intervention strategies including 2D and 3D plots of user-selected metabolic fluxes or yields.

Our method, cryoFIRE, performs ab initio heterogeneous reconstruction with unknown poses in an amortized framework, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive step of pose search while enabling the analysis of conformational heterogeneity. Poses and conformation are jointly estimated by an encoder while a physics-based decoder aggregates the images into an implicit neural representation of the conformational space.

A photon is absorbed by the 11-cis retinal chromophore of rhodopsin which isomerises within 200 femtoseconds to the all-trans conformation, thereby initiating the cellular signal transduction processes that ultimately lead to vision. However, the intramolecular mechanism by which the photoactivated retinal induces the activation events inside rhodopsin remains elusive. In this work, we use ultrafast time-resolved crystallography at room temperature to determine how an isomerised twisted all-trans retinal stores the photon energy required to initiate protein conformational changes associated with the formation of the G protein-binding signalling state. The distorted retinal at 1 ps time-delay of photoactivation has pulled away from half of its numerous interactions with its binding pocket, and the excess of the photon energy is released through an anisotropic protein breathing motion in the direction of the extracellular space. Strikingly, the very early structural motions in the protein side chains of rhodopsin appear in regions involved in later stages of the conserved Class A GPCR activation mechanism.

For systems where single determinant wave functions are qualitatively accurate, we expect the accuracy of ph-AFQMC in conjunction with a single determinant trial wave function to be between that of coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) and CCSD with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)). For these applications, ph-AFQMC should be a method of choice when canonical CCSD(T) is too expensive to run. For systems where multi-reference (MR) wave functions are needed for qualitative accuracy, ph-AFQMC is far more accurate than MR perturbation theory methods and competitive with MR configuration interaction (MRCI) methods.

We present a structure of the KstD from Sterolibacterium denitrificans (AcmB), which contains a previously uncharacterized membrane-associated domain and extended proton-relay system. The experimental and theoretical studies show that the steroid 1,2-dehydrogenation proceeds according to the Ping-Pong bi-bi kinetics and a two-step base-assisted elimination (E2cB) mechanism. The mechanism is validated by evaluating the experimental and theoretical kinetic isotope effect for deuterium substituted substrates. The role of the active site residues is quantitatively assessed by point mutations, experimental activity assays, and QM/MM MD modeling of the reductive half-reaction (RHR). The pre-steady-state kinetics also reveals that the low pH (6.5) optimum of AcmB is dictated by the oxidative half-reaction (OHR), while the RHR exhibits a slight optimum at the pH usual for the KstD family of 8.5.

We tracked the reactivity of such bonds associated with the rise of the resistance to penicillin G (PenG) in protein evolution from penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to TEM beta-lactamases, and with the development of avibactam (Avb) to overcome the resistance. We found that the ester linkage in PBP–PenG is resistant to hydrolysis mainly due to the small electric fields present in the protein active site. Conversely, the same linkage in the descendant TEM–PenG experiences large electric fields which stabilize the more charge-separated transition state and thus lower the free energy barrier to hydrolysis. Specifically, the electric fields were improved from -59 to -140 MV/cm in an ancient evolution dating back billions of years, contributing 5 orders of magnitude rate acceleration. This trend continues today in the nullification of newly developed antibiotic drugs. The fast linkage hydrolysis acquired from evolution is counteracted by the upgrade of PenG to Avb whose linkage escapes from the hydrolysis by returning to a low-field environment.

Recent advances in machine learning applications to protein structure prediction show potential for automating this process. Taking inspiration from these techniques, we have built ModelAngelo for automated model building of proteins in cryo-EM maps. ModelAngelo first uses a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to initialize a graph representation with nodes assigned to individual amino acids of the proteins in the map and edges representing the protein chain. The graph is then refined with a graph neural network (GNN) that combines the cryo-EM data, the amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries. The GNN refines the geometry of the protein chain and classifies the amino acids for each of its nodes. The final graph is post-processed with a hidden Markov model (HMM) search to map each protein chain to entries in a user provided sequence file.

To address the roles of Tyr and Trp in these oxidases, we herein report the preparation of the same biosynthetic model with the Tyr replaced by Trp and further demonstrate that Trp can also promote the ORR, albeit with lower activity. An X-ray crystal structure of the Trp variant shows a hydrogen-bonding network involving two water molecules that are organized by Trp, similar to that in the Tyr variant, which is absent in the crystal structure with the native Phe residue. Additional electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are consistent with the formation of a Trp radical species upon reacting with H2O2. We attribute the lower activity of the Trp variant to Trp’s higher reduction potential relative to Tyr. Together, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that Trp can indeed promote the ORR and provides a structural basis for the observation of varying activities.

For example, many methods have been developed to predict protein intrinsic disorder from sequence, including our Rosetta ResidueDisorder (RRD) approach. Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins are parts of the sequence that do not form ordered, folded structures under typical physiological conditions. In the original implementation of RRD, Rosetta ab initio models were generated, and disordered regions were predicted based on residue scores (disordered residues typically exist in regions of unfavorable scores). In this work, we show that by (i) replacing the ab initio modeling with AF (using the same scoring and disorder assignment approach) and (ii) updating the score function, the predictiveness improved significantly. Residues were better ranked by the order/disorder, evidenced by an improvement in receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve from 0.69 to 0.78 on a large (229 protein) and balanced data set (relatively even ordered versus disordered residues).

To this end, we use a simplified energetic model to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) accommodation on the ribosome. While numerous studies have probed the energetics of the early stages of accommodation, we focus on the final stage of accommodation, where the 3′-CCA tail of aa-tRNA enters the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). These simulations show how a distinct intermediate is induced by steric confinement of the tail, immediately before it completes accommodation. Multiple pathways for 3′-CCA tail accommodation can be quantitatively distinguished, where the tail enters the PTC by moving past a pocket enclosed by Helix 89, 90, and 92, or through an alternate route formed by Helix 93 and the P-site tRNA. C2573, located within Helix 90, is shown to provide the largest contribution to this late-accommodation steric barrier, such that sub-Å perturbations to this residue can alter the time scale of tail accommodation by nearly an order of magnitude.

However, ligands binding at the same location generally show little or no similarity, and the amino acid residues interacting with these ligands also differ. Results confirm the possibility of specifically targeting these sites across GPCRs for allosteric modulation and help to identify the most likely binding sites among the limited number of potential locations.

A way to deal with the issue is to use machine learning to increase the rate at which drugs are made available to the public. However, chemical labeled data for real-world applications is extremely scarce making traditional approaches less effective. A fruitful course of action for this challenge is to pretrain a model using related tasks with large enough datasets, with the next step being finetuning it for the desired task. This is challenging as creating these datasets requires labeled data or expert knowledge. To aid in solving this pressing issue, we introduce MISU - Molecular Inherent SUpervision, a unique method for pretraining graph neural networks for molecular property prediction. Our method leapfrogs past the need for labeled data or any expert knowledge by introducing three innovative components that utilize inherent properties of molecular graphs to induce information extraction at different scales, from the local neighborhood of an atom to substructures in the entire molecule. Our empirical results for six chemical-property-prediction tasks show that our method reaches state-of-the-art results compared to numerous baselines.",2022-10-17,2022-11-04 05:37:13,2022-11-04 05:37:20,2022-11-03,2903–2912,,,,,,,CIKM '22,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/BUC93UXW/Benjamin et al. - 2022 - Graph Neural Networks Pretraining Through Inherent.pdf

With the reaction launched from a superposition of two local basis states, we hypothesize that the ensuing motions of the electrons and nuclei will proceed, conceptually, in lockstep as a superposition of probability amplitudes until decoherence collapses the system to a product.

The partition modifiers can be naturally introduced into the partition representation of enzymatic reaction networks when applied to search. By randomly applying the partition modifiers as appropriate, we searched for bistable and resettable enzymatic reaction networks consisting of four post-translational modification reactions. The proposed search algorithm worked well and we were able to find various bistable enzymatic reaction networks, including a typical bistable enzymatic reaction network with positive auto-feedbacks and mutually negative regulations. Since the search algorithm is divided into an evaluation function specific to the characteristics of the enzymatic reaction network to be searched and an independent algorithm part, it may be applied to search for dynamic properties such as biochemical adaptation, the ability to reset the biochemical state after responding to a stimulus, by replacing the evaluation function with one for other characteristics.",2022-01-26,2022-11-08 07:49:41,2022-11-08 07:49:41,2022-11-08 07:49:41,e0263111,,1,17,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/M5Y8FHL6/Naka - 2022 - The partition representation of enzymatic reaction.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/KM7ACTUH/article.html

However, molecular function of this evolutionarily conserved kinase and the mechanisms through which TAOK1 mutations lead to neuropathology are unknown. Here, we showed that TAOK1 is highly expressed in neurons within the brain, and has a functional role in remodeling the plasma membrane through direct association with phosphoinositides. We characterized four NDD-associated TAOK1 mutations, and demonstrated that these mutations render TAOK1 catalytically dead. Kinase dead TAOK1 mutants were aberrantly trapped in membrane-bound state, which induced exuberant membrane protrusions. Expression of TAOK1 disease mutants in hippocampal neurons led to abnormal growth of the dendritic arbor. The coiled-coil region C-terminal to the kinase domain are predicted to fold into a triple helix. We showed that this triple helix directly bound phospholipids, and was required for both TAOK1 membrane association and induction of aberrant protrusions. Further, TAOK1 mutants were rescued from their membrane-trapped state by exogenous expression of the isolated kinase domain. Utilizing mass-spectrometry, we identified critical residues in the triple helix phosphorylated by TAOK1 that autoregulated its plasma membrane association. These findings define a previously unknown function of TAOK1 as a unique plasma membrane remodeling kinase, and reveal the underlying mechanisms through which TAOK1 dysfunction leads to neurodevelopmental disorders.",2022-07-06,2022-11-19 01:54:00,2022-11-19 01:54:00,2022-11-19 01:54:00,,,,,,,,,,,,bioRxiv,,en,"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The relative third-order rate constants for activation of adenylate kinase, by the C-5 truncated adenosine 1-(β-d-erythrofuranosyl)adenine (EA), for catalysis of phosphoryl transfer from ATP to phosphite dianion (HP, kcat/KHPKAct = 260 M–2 s–1), fluorophosphate (47 M–2 s–1), and phosphate (9.6 M–2 s–1), show that substitution of −F for −H and of −OH for −H at HP results, respectively, in decreases in the reactivity of AK for catalysis of phosphoryl transfer due to polar and steric effects of the −F and −OH substituents.

Here, we explore distinct properties of the sPRE arising from nitroxide-based cosolutes and provide new insights into the interpretation of the sPRE and sPRE-derived ϕENS. We show that: (a) the longitudinal sPRE rate Γ1 is heavily dependent on spectrometer field and viscosity, while the transverse sPRE rate Γ2 is much less so; (b) the spectral density J(0) is proportional to the inverse of the relative translational diffusion constant and is related to the quantity ⟨r–4⟩norm, a concentration-normalized equilibrium average of the electron–proton interspin separation; and (c) attractive intermolecular interactions result in a shortening of the residue-specific effective correlation time for the electron–proton vector. We discuss four different approaches for evaluating ϕENS based on Γ2, J(0), Γ1, or ⟨r–6⟩norm. The latter is evaluated from the magnetic field dependence of Γ1 in conjunction with Γ2. Long-range interactions dominate J(0) and Γ2, while, at high magnetic fields, the contribution of short-range interactions becomes significant for J(ω) and hence Γ1; the four ϕENS quantities enable one to probe both long- and short-range electrostatic interactions. The experimental ϕENS potentials were evaluated using three model protein systems, two folded (ubiquitin and native drkN SH3) and one intrinsically disordered (unfolded state of drkN SH3), in relation to theoretical ϕENS potentials calculated from atomic coordinates using the Poisson-Boltzmann theory with either a r–6 or r–4 dependence.",2022-11-23,2022-11-30 22:08:47,2022-11-30 22:08:47,2022-11-30 22:08:46,21371-21388,,46,144,,J.

It is well known that, due to the impacts of various environmental factors, it is difficult to identify the conserved water molecules (CWMs) from free water molecules (FWMs) directly as CWMs are normally deeply embedded in proteins and form strong hydrogen bonds with surrounding polar groups. To circumvent this difficulty, in this work, the abundance of spatial structure information and physicochemical properties of water molecules in proteins inspires us to adopt machine learning methods for identifying the CWMs. Therefore, in this study, a machine learning framework to identify the CWMs in the binding sites of the proteins was presented. First, by analyzing water molecules’ physicochemical properties and spatial structure information, six features (i.e., atom density, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, solvent-accessible surface area, temperature B-factors, and mobility) were extracted. Those features were further analyzed and combined to reach a higher CWM identification rate. As a result, an optimal feature combination was determined. Based on this optimal combination, seven different machine learning models (including support vector machine (SVM),                                                   K                                               -nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), discriminant analysis (DA), naïve Bayes (NB), and ensemble learning (EL)) were evaluated for their abilities in identifying two categories of water molecules, i.e., CWMs and FWMs. It showed that the EL model was the desired prediction model due to its comprehensive advantages. Furthermore, the presented methodology was validated through a case study of crystal 3skh and extensively compared with Dowser++. The prediction performance showed that the optimal feature combination and the desired EL model in our method could achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy in identifying CWMs from FWMs in the proteins’ binding sites.",2022-10-03,2022-12-01 16:31:20,2022-12-01 16:31:20,2022-12-01 16:31:20,1-11,,,2022,,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/3BFW9YT3/Xiao et al. - 2022 - Predicting Conserved Water Molecules in Binding Si.pdf

We recently developed StarMap, an easy-to-use interface between the popular structural display program ChimeraX and Rosetta, a powerful molecular modeling engine. StarMap offers a general approach for refining structural models of biological macromolecules into cryo-EM density maps by combining Monte Carlo sampling with local density-guided optimization, Rosetta-based all-atom refinement and real-space B-factor calculations in a straightforward workflow. StarMap includes options for structural symmetry, local refinements and independent model validation. The overall quality of the refinement and the structure resolution is then assessed via analytical outputs, such as magnification calibration (pixel size calibration) and Fourier shell correlations. Z-scores reported by StarMap provide an easily interpretable indicator of the goodness of fit for each residue and can be plotted to evaluate structural models and improve local residue refinements, as well as to identify flexible regions and potentially functional sites in large macromolecular complexes. The protocol requires general computer skills, without the need for coding expertise, because most parts of the workflow can be operated by clicking tabs within the ChimeraX graphical user interface. Time requirements for the model refinement depend on the size and quality of the input data; however, this step can typically be completed within 1 d.

Odinarchaeota belongs to the Asgard archaeal phylum that is believed to be the closest known ancestor to eukaryotes.

While the mechanism of nucleotide selection and polymerization is well understood, it remains a mystery why bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes exhibit an unexpected and surprisingly low tRNA substrate affinity while they efficiently catalyze the CCA-addition. To get insights into the evolution of this high-fidelity RNA synthesis, the reconstruction and characterization of ancestral enzymes is a versatile tool. Here, we investigate a reconstructed candidate of a 2 billion years old CCA-adding enzyme from Gammaproteobacteria and compare it to the corresponding modern enzyme of Escherichia coli. We show that the ancestral candidate catalyzes an error-free CCA-addition, but has a much higher tRNA affinity compared with the extant enzyme. The consequence of this increased substrate binding is an enhanced reverse reaction, where the enzyme removes the CCA end from the mature tRNA. As a result, the ancestral candidate exhibits a lower catalytic efficiency in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, the efficient tRNA interaction leads to a processive polymerization, while the extant enzyme catalyzes nucleotide addition in a distributive way. Thus, the modern enzymes increased their polymerization efficiency by lowering the binding affinity to tRNA, so that CCA synthesis is efficiently promoted due to a reduced reverse reaction. Hence, the puzzling and at a first glance contradicting and detrimental weak substrate interaction represents a distinct activity enhancement in the evolution of CCA-adding enzymes.",2022-12-01,2022-12-11 20:39:39,2022-12-11 20:39:39,2022-12-11 20:39:39,msac250,,12,39,,Molecular Biology and Evolution,Substrate Affinity Versus Catalytic Efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/63UMHFYT/Hager et al. - 2022 - Substrate Affinity Versus Catalytic Efficiency An.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/VGQGHJEK/6835633.html

Protein structures may not, however, completely resolve all critical bound water molecules, or there may be no experimental data available. As such, predicting the location of water molecules in the absence of a crystal structure is important in the context of rational drug design. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) is a computational technique that is gaining popularity for the simulation of buried water sites. In this work, we assess the ability of GCMC to accurately predict water binding locations, using a dataset that we have curated, containing 108 unique structures of complexes between proteins and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small-molecule drugs. We show that GCMC correctly predicts 81.4% of nonbulk crystallographic water sites to within 1.4 Å. However, our analysis demonstrates that the reported performance of water prediction methods is highly sensitive to the way in which the performance is measured. We also find that crystallographic water sites with more protein/ligand hydrogen bonds and stronger electron density are more reliably predicted by GCMC. An analysis of water networks revealed that more than half of the structures contain at least one ligand-contacting water network. In these cases, displacement of a water site by a ligand modification might yield unexpected results if the larger network is destabilized. Cooperative effects between waters should therefore be explicitly considered in structure-based drug design.",2022-12-05,2022-12-11 20:40:03,2022-12-11 20:40:03,2022-12-11 20:40:03,,,,,,J. Chem. Inf.

Herein, we review approaches and tools for predicting stability changes upon the single-point variant. Most of these methods require tertiary protein structure as input to achieve reliable predictions. However, the availability of protein structures limits the immediate application of these tools. To improve the performance of a computational prediction from a protein sequence without experimental structural information, we introduce a new computational framework: MU3DSP. This method assesses the effects of single-point variants on protein thermodynamic stability based on point mutated protein 3D structure profile. Given a protein sequence with a single variant as input, MU3DSP integrates both sequence-level features and averaged features of 3D structures obtained from sequence alignment to PDB to assess the change of thermodynamic stability induced by the substitution. MU3DSP outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks, making it a reliable tool to assess both somatic and germline substitution variants and assist in protein design.

A number of approaches have been developed to these ends, ranging from the widely used fast molecular docking to the computationally expensive enhanced sampling molecular simulations. In this context, methods such as coarse-grained metadynamics and binding pose metadynamics (BPMD) use simulations with metadynamics biasing to probe the binding affinity without trying to fully converge the binding free energy landscape in order to decrease the computational cost. In BPMD, the metadynamics bias perturbs the ligand away from the initial pose. The resistance of the ligand to this bias is used to calculate a stability score. The method has been shown to be useful in reranking predicted binding poses from docking. Here, we present OpenBPMD, an open-source Python reimplementation and reinterpretation of BPMD.

De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins 5,6 . However, the design of interactions between proteins and short helical peptides is an unmet challenge. Here, we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that with the RF diffusion generative model, picomolar affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets either by noising and then denoising lower affinity designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions; to our knowledge these are the highest affinity designed binding proteins against any protein or small molecule target generated directly by computation without any experimental optimization. The RF diffusion designs enable the enrichment of parathyroid hormone or other bioactive peptides in human plasma and subsequent detection by mass spectrometry, and bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. Capture reagents for bioactive helical peptides generated using the methods described here could aid in the improved diagnosis and therapeutic management of human diseases. 7,8",2022,2022-12-18 15:59:54,2022-12-18 15:59:54,2022-12-18 15:59:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Europe PMC,,DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.10.519862 Type: article,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/N35ARE8F/Vázquez Torres et al. - 2022 - De novo design of high-affinity protein binders to.pdf

By constructing reduced TiO2 as the catalyst model, supported by the developed operando EPR and multiple in situ characterization results, we confirm the generation of previously unrevealed active sites of photoexcited oxygen vacancies (Vo) and further dissect the formation, rebirth, and evolvement of dynamic Vo at the electronic level. Subsequently, the consistent theoretical and experimental results comprehensively justify the dynamic photoexcited Vo as the true active site directly determining the catalytic performance, subverting the classical perception of predesigned Vo as the active site.

It incorporates the sequence embedding from a supervised transformer protein language model into a multi-scale network enhanced by knowledge distillation to predict inter-residue two-dimensional geometry, which is then used to reconstruct three-dimensional structures via energy minimization.

For training, we build a unique dataset of unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 9 ms for twelve different proteins with multiple secondary structure arrangements. The coarse-grained models are capable of accelerating the dynamics by more than three orders of magnitude while preserving the thermodynamics of the systems. Coarse-grained simulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable energetics to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single coarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture experimental structural features of mutated proteins.

Two different classes of TtuI proteins, which possess a PP-loop-containing pyrophosphatase domain that includes a conserved cysteine important for catalysis, have been identified. The first class, as exemplified by the prototypic Escherichia coli enzyme, possesses an additional C-terminal rhodanese domain harboring a second cysteine, which serves to form a catalytic persulfide. Among the second class of TtuI proteins that do not possess the rhodanese domain, some archaeal proteins display a conserved CXXC + C motif. We report here spectroscopic and enzymatic studies showing that TtuI from Methanococcus maripaludis and Pyrococcus furiosus can assemble a [4Fe–4S] cluster that is essential for tRNA sulfuration activity.

However, all-atom simulations are computationally expensive and require long simulation times for the diffusion of small molecules dissolved in polymers. MD-GAN, a machine learning model, is effective in accelerating simulations and reducing computational costs. The target systems for MD-GAN prediction were limited to polyethylene melts in previous studies; therefore, this study extended MD-GAN to systems containing copolymers with branches and successfully predicted water diffusion in various polymers.

The CdS nanocrystals are approximately 3 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscope, with optical properties similar to those seen in chemically synthesized quantum dots. The CdS nanocrystals synthesized using ConK have slower growth rates and a different growth mechanism than those synthesized using natural biomineralization pathways. The slower growth rate yields CdS nanocrystals with two desirable properties not observed during biomineralization using natural proteins. First, CdS nanocrystals are predominantly of the zinc blende crystal phase; this is in stark contrast to natural biomineralization routes that produce a mixture of zinc blende and wurtzite phase CdS. Second, in contrast to the growth and eventual precipitation observed in natural biomineralization systems, the CdS nanocrystals produced by ConK stabilize at a final size. Future optimization of CdS nanocrystal growth using ConK—or other de novo proteins—may help to overcome the limits on nanocrystal quality typically observed from natural biomineralization by enabling the synthesis of more stable, high-quality quantum dots at room temperature.",2022-12-20,2022-12-23 03:09:15,2022-12-23 03:09:15,2022-12-23 03:09:14,e2204050119,,51,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pnas.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,,

Finally, we show that urine levels of               N               5               -methylglutamine correlate with tumor burden and GS expression in a β-catenin-driven model of liver cancer, highlighting the translational potential of this uncharacterized metabolite.",2022-10-24,2022-12-25 03:30:48,2022-12-25 03:30:48,2022-12-25 03:30:48,,,,,,Nat Chem Biol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/ZFBZ9DEW/Villar et al. - 2022 - Hepatic glutamine synthetase controls N5-methylglu.pdf

However, building accurate models into intermediate-resolution EM maps remains challenging and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic model building method of multi-chain protein complexes from intermediate-resolution cryo-EM maps, named EMBuild, by integrating AlphaFold structure prediction, FFT-based global fitting, domain-based semi-flexible refinement, and graph-based iterative assembling on the main-chain probability map predicted by a deep convolutional network. EMBuild is extensively evaluated on diverse test sets of 47 single-particle EM maps at 4.0–8.0 Å resolution and 16 subtomogram averaging maps of cryo-ET data at 3.7–9.3 Å resolution, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. We demonstrate that EMBuild is able to build high-quality complex structures that are comparably accurate to the manually built PDB structures from the cryo-EM maps. These results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of EMBuild in automatic model building.",2022-07-13,2023-01-03 18:11:09,2023-01-03 18:11:14,2023-01-03 18:11:09,4066,,1,13,,Nat Commun,,,,,,,,en,2022 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/TXNWSKBL/He et al. - 2022 - Model building of protein complexes from intermedi.pdf

Along with knowledge about the imaged molecules, cryo-EM maps allow de novo atomic modelling, which is typically done through a laborious manual process. Taking inspiration from recent advances in machine learning applications to protein structure prediction, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) approach for automated model building of proteins in cryo-EM maps. The GNN acts on a graph with nodes assigned to individual amino acids and edges representing the protein chain. Combining information from the voxel-based cryo-EM data, the amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries, the GNN refines the geometry of the protein chain and classifies the amino acids for each of its nodes. Application to 28 test cases shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and approximates manual building for cryo-EM maps with resolutions better than 3.5 \r{A}.",2022-11-21,2023-01-06 03:10:19,2023-01-06 03:10:25,2023-01-06 03:10:19,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2210.00006 [cs, q-bio]",,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/XDXBSTT9/Jamali et al. - 2022 - A graph neural network approach to automated model.pdf; /home/northja/Zotero/storage/UTQZR54F/2210.html

These models use various objective functions and optimization schemes. The choice of objective function and optimization scheme comes with trade-offs that are not always well explained. We introduce probabilistic definitions of protein stability and conformational specificity and show how these chemical properties relate to the p(structure| seq) objective used in recent protein design algorithms. This links probabilistic objective functions to experimentally testable outcomes. We present a new sequence decoding algorithm, termed “BayesDesign”, that uses Bayes’ Rule to maximize the p(structure| seq) objective.

Studying proteins at atomic resolution in living mammalian cells has been elusive due to the lack of methodologies. In-cell nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (in-cell NMR) is an emerging technique with the power to do so. Here, we improved current methods of in-cell NMR by the development of a reporter system that allows monitoring the delivery of exogenous proteins into mammalian cells, a process that we called here “transexpression”. The reporter system was used to develop an efficient protocol for in-cell NMR which enables spectral acquisition with higher quality for both disordered and folded proteins. With this method, the 3D atomic resolution structure of the model protein GB1 in human cells was determined with a backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.1 Å.",2022-12-02,2023-01-15 00:02:17,2023-01-15 00:02:17,2023-01-15 00:02:17,1-14,,1,5,,Commun Biol,,,,,,,,en,2022 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,/home/northja/Zotero/storage/3NLWEAIU/Gerez et al. - 2022 - Protein structure determination in human cells by .pdf
